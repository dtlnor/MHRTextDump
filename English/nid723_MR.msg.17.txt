<string>Hoohoo hoho! Over here!
<string>Ah, sorry for stopping you. You look<lf>like an experienced hunter. Can you<lf>indulge me for a moment?
<string>Are you familiar with the Astalos? I've<lf>never seen such a wild and rampaging<lf>monster, not in all my days! Hoohoo!
<string>As a scholar, I'm fascinated by whatever<lf>it is that drives a monster into such an<lf>insane frenzy.
<string>That's why I need you to catch one of<lf>them for me. Can you help fulfill this<lf>old man's curiosity?
<string>Marvelous work!
<string>What a fine specimen! Thank you, Hunter!<lf>And thanks to you, my research is surging<lf>ahead! Hoo hoo!
<string>As a thank you, I'll teach you how to<lf>make some exciting new armor. Head<lf>over to the Smithy and take a look.
<string>Ah, isn't this world still filled with<lf>mysteries! We seek to uncover them all,<lf>but would that be a good thing?
<string>Hoo hoo ho ho! This sure is a surprise.<lf>You're from Kamura, are you not?
<string>You could be just what we need. I've heard<lf>incredible things about hunters born and<lf>raised there!
<string>You remind me of a young hunter I once<lf>knew. Can't remember his name though...<lf>What was it... Doogen... Poogen...
<string>Oh, silly me, I remember now! FUGEN!<lf>Yes, yes... I imagine he must have grown<lf>up quite a bit since then. Hoo hoooo!
<string>Oh, pardon my manners I have yet to<lf>properly introduce myself. My name<lf>is Pasapato!
<string>You might be wondering why an old relic<lf>like myself is in this military outpost.<lf>That answer is simple: Malzeno.
<string>There aren't many who were around when<lf>Malzeno first emerged... This crater that's<lf>come to be known as "the Sun"...
<string>And the other like it near the capital are<lf>intertwined in all of this. And I hope to be<lf>around when this mystery is unraveled.
<string>It appears we have guests.<lf>How exciting!
<string>At my age, visitors don't come along very<lf>often, even if I wanted them to.
<string>Tell me, young Hunter. Does the rampage<lf>still plague your homeland of Kamura?
<string>Hmm...I see. Monsters move in mysterious<lf>ways, my young friend, no matter where<lf>they are from.
<string>Even for an old relic like me, there are still<lf>many things I have yet to learn.
<string>Perhaps you are aware that Malzeno<lf>is one of the Three Lords...?
<string>We don't know what kind of relationship<lf>they have with each other... Or don't have.
<string>Regardless, we should rely on the eyes and<lf>ears of you hunters and not some silly old<lf>tales as the source of our information.
<string>As a scholar myself, I'm very much looking<lf>forward to what you discover!
<string>Just like any other creature, the habitat of<lf>a monster does not change easily.
<string>Long-term change is expected, but the<lf>stories we've been hearing lately about the<lf>Kingdom's monsters are quite unusual...
<string>It appears we have an anomaly on our hands.<lf>It's not ideal, but I guess it's unavoidable.
<string>Go now hunter. I pray your investigation<lf>will yield some clues to this mystery.
<string>Monsters don't go out of their way to<lf>change their habitat without a good<lf>reason.
<string>The influence of the Kingdom's monsters<lf>extends far. It cannot be controlled or<lf>resisted.
<string>Hoo hoo! Hohoho! Just as expected.<lf>A fool will continue to do foolish things!<lf>Hoo hoo!
<string>Let me guess, the man obliviously wandered<lf>deep into monster territory? ...Again?
<string>It would do him some good just to leave<lf>him out there. Hoo hoo! Let him learn<lf>his lesson!
<string>What do you think? Hoo hoo.<lf>Has the fool learned his lesson yet?
<string>We'll let him off this time, but if I know<lf>Bahari...he'll be back. He won't leave<lf>empty-handed. Hoo hoo! No, no, no!
<string>Going after that Garangolm, are you?<lf>That beast is quite the behemoth,<lf>would you agree? Hoo hoo!
<string>But any monster can be hunted. You<lf>know the old saying, "The bigger they<lf>come, the harder they fall!"
<string>And the behemoth falls! Hoo hoo!<lf>This alone has made my trip all the<lf>way out here worthwhile!
<string>To be able to study a massive specimen<lf>such as this! Hoo hoo! Quite the rare<lf>opportunity indeed!
<string>Perhaps I'm even more excited about<lf>it than that fool, Bahari, hoo hoo!<lf>I'm certainly not getting any younger!
<string>Things are starting to get interesting.<lf>But these old legs of mine are far too<lf>weak to start chasing monsters around.
<string>Please, take care of Bahari for me. He's still<lf>a young fool, but he's a useful fool. Certainly<lf>more useful than this old bag of bones.
<string>Thanks to your fine work capturing that<lf>beast, new light has been shed on this<lf>mystery. And it all links to the Qurio...
<string>Had there been hunters like you in the<lf>Kingdom when I was young, things would<lf>have been much more interesting. Hoo hoo!
<string>What I wouldn't give to be young again.<lf>That's why I can't stand Bahari sometimes.<lf>*sigh* Youth is wasted on the young...
<string>If they are anything like the Garangolm,<lf>I'm sure the Lunagaron will not be<lf>an easy opponent either.
<string>But I'm not worried at all. Hoo hoo!<lf>I see not a single sign of fear on your face.<lf>Best of luck to you, my friend!
<string>I heard the Malzeno you saw was<lf>somehow different from the one<lf>I've come to know.
<string>What relationship does it have with<lf>the Qurio? And why do the Qurio<lf>drive monsters berserk?
<string>With answers come more questions...<lf>When I think of how far things have come,<lf>I can't help but be amused. Hoo hoo!
<string>The plague that spread throughout<lf>the Kingdom... Yes, I remember it<lf>well. How could I forget?
<string>The doctor who saved us should be able to<lf>come up with something impressive. No matter<lf>what poison Malzeno possesses, there is hope!
<string>So Malzeno and the Qurio were behind<lf>the plague that nearly decimated the<lf>Kingdom... I had no idea!
<string>Even after all these years I'm still amazed<lf>at what I can learn! Hoo hoo!
<string>I was curious about the medicine. So<lf>I went to see how it was prepared, but<lf>then Tadori kicked me out. Hoo hoo!
<string>Still, I'm rather curious... Hoo hoo!<lf>I wonder how I might get a better view...
<string>If only we could defeat Malzeno, then<lf>the threat posed by the Three Lords<lf>would certainly be eliminated.
<string>But we still don't know what part<lf>these craters play in all this. Still...
<string>If your victory means an end to this<lf>matter, I would be very happy indeed.<lf>We're counting on you, my friend.
<string>Hoo hoo! Well done, my friend!<lf>Well done!
<string>I'd like to say that everything is fine,<lf>but I'm still concerned about the Qurio...
<string>I guess we're all going to need your<lf>assistance for a little while longer.
<string>Hmmm... There is still much to learn<lf>about the Qurio. No wonder Bahari<lf>can't give us any answers.
<string>While everyone is worried about the<lf>Qurio, I can't help but think about<lf>these craters...
<string>Mysterious indeed! How were they<lf>created? Not a single person knows...
<string>No reliable information exists. The<lf>Kingdom's records are full of holes<lf>as big as the craters themselves!
<string>But perhaps our Admiral Galleus<lf>knows something! I'm sure of it!<lf>Hoo hoo!
<string>Hmmm...<lf>This is certainly strange weather we're having.
<string>I see that it's not just us researchers<lf>feeling gloomy these days...
<string>Still, there's something awfully familiar<lf>about it. Hmmm... Interesting. Interesting<lf>indeed! Hoo hoo!
<string>I see... So the Qurio are returning to<lf>the Citadel... The place where Malzeno<lf>first appeared...
<string>We're getting closer, I can feel it! But as<lf>much as I'd like to accompany you, I'm<lf>afraid these old bones can't make the trip.
<string>I knew it! The Admiral had already reached<lf>his own conclusion. What an incredible man!
<string>And these craters weren't the work of Malzeno...
<string>Yes, yes! There was something familiar<lf>about all of these occurrences... And now<lf>the pieces have all fallen together.
<string>I'd say the picture is quite clear!<lf>Quite clear indeed! Hoo hoo!
<string>Now, now. You can't be too careful now,<lf>can you? Hoo hoo!
<string>You never know what might be <lf>lurking in the dark depths!
<string>I don't mean to frighten you! No, no!<lf>Just a bit of fun. But you are curious,<lf>are you not!? Hoo hoo!
<string>This really is a lovely place to sit. With<lf>the soothing sound of the water behind<lf>me and the succulent aroma of dango...
<string>Why, I could get lost in thought for<lf>hours. Lost in thought... What we<lf>were talking about again?
<string>Mmm... I had planned to taste those<lf>delicious-looking dango today, but...
<string>I always feel full just by watching those<lf>two men behind me eat...
<string>Oh, well... Perhaps when Utsushi comes<lf>'round again I shall invite him to partake<lf>in a few.
<string>Who do I have to ask to get a ride on<lf>the Spelunker?
<string>Would you mind asking someone<lf>for me?
<string>While I appreciate you humoring me,<lf>Kamura Hunter, you've no need for an<lf>old relic's stories... Not at a time like this.
<string>After all, it was your intuition and skill<lf>that saved Kamura from calamity.
<string>Well then, I'll let you get back to throwing<lf>yourself at those monsters! Hoo hoo!
<string>Malzeno and the Qurio... The Kingdom<lf>monsters... These craters... Hoo hoo!<lf>What is the connection!?
<string>This is what I've been contemplating,<lf>but I probably should keep quiet for<lf>now. The situation is still evolving...
<string>You should be out there dealing with<lf>the present rather than here listening<lf>to this old relic's stories of the past.
<string>By the way, Hunter? How is your<lf>Master Utsushi doing? I really am<lf>looking forward to talking to him.
<string>There are not many, other than Admiral<lf>Galleus and Bahari, who listen to my<lf>old tales with such interest.
<string>Perhaps it's due to your customs, but<lf>you Kamura folk sure know how to<lf>treat us old timers.
<string>You could learn a thing or two from me,<lf>you know. Learn from yesterday, live for<lf>today, as they say!
<string>Over here, Hunter!
<string>Cohoots are such lovely creatures,<lf>wouldn't you agree? Hoo hoo!<lf>I'm simply fascinated by them!
<string>I thought to write a friend back home<lf>about them, because they are such<lf>rare creatures, but then I thought...
<string>Wouldn't it be marvelous to include some<lf>photos!? I'd take them myself, but these<lf>old hands of mine shake something fierce!
<string>Could I trouble you to take some for me?<lf>Any pictures of Cohoots in Elgado will do!<lf>Well, young whippersnapper, get snapping!
<string>Simply marvelous!
<string>Hoo hoo! What beautiful photos! This<lf>will be perfect for my friend. Thank<lf>you so much for indulging an old man.
<string>The reward I've prepared is some layered<lf>armor with a Cohoot design. A Smithy<lf>I grew up with made it for me, but...
<string>I'd look ridiculous wearing this, but you're<lf>young, perhaps you can make it work!
