<string>This doesn't look good...
<string><PL>. As you are aware,<lf>we have a situation that needs your attention.
<string>Orders have come in for you to hunt<lf>the Daimyo Hermitaur that's wandered<lf>into the Shrine Ruins.
<string>I have done a bit of research and you're in for<lf>a real fight. Their massive claws are more than<lf>capable of crushing anything, especially hunters!
<string>Do be careful out there. Extra EXTRA careful.<lf>Unlike the Rampage, we've never dealt with<lf>anything like this before.
<string>Would you like to go hunting together?
<string><NOFAC>Um, <PL>...<lf>I wonder if I could ask you a favor.
<string>As you know, we Kamura defenders are<lf>encouraged to go out hunting as part of<lf>our training.
<string>However, we must be accompanied by<lf>a qualified hunter. <PL>, I was<lf>wondering if you'd help me hone my skills.
<string>Even after taking part in defending Kamura<lf>from the Rampage I'm still an inexperienced<lf>defender. I must improve to keep Hinoa safe.
<string>Ugh, I hate going outside, but if that's<lf>what it takes to ensure my sister's<lf>safety, so be it. Will you help me?
<string>Thank you.
<string><NOFAC>Thank you, <PL>.<lf>I really appreciate your help. It means a lot.
<string>Even with all my training, I felt like<lf>a complete amateur out there. More<lf>so when watching you...
<string>But I know that if I put my mind to it and<lf>train harder, I'll be strong enough to protect<lf>Kamura and Hinoa. I have to!
<string>With that in mind, <PL>,<lf>I hope we can do this again sometime soon.
<string>Would you like to go hunting together?
<string><NOFAC><PL>, would you assist me<lf>with my training again?
<string>Thanks to you, I gained a great deal<lf>of valuable experience from our previous<lf>outing.
<string>I'd like to build on what I learned and<lf>hone my skills further. Please tell me<lf>you'll help me.
<string>I'll do whatever it takes to keep my sister<lf>safe. I'd really appreciate it, <PL>.<lf>Truly.
<string>Thank you.
<string><NOFAC>Thank you, <PL>.
<string>With every training session, I feel like<lf>I'm improving. I'm starting to feel more<lf>and more confident as well.
<string>But I must do more. I must become stronger.
<string>And being a village defender, the stronger<lf>I become, the lighter the load on you<lf>hunters. Win-win, right?
<string>Anyway, I don't care how much training<lf>it takes, I must keep Hinoa safe. I hope<lf>you'll ask me to join you again soon.
<string>I've never seen Rondine so flustered.<lf>She's always as cool and composed<lf>as the calm evening ocean.
<string>That tells me how serious this new<lf>situation is. Please be careful.
<string>The time has finally come for you to go<lf>far beyond the village. Of course, we<lf>all knew this moment would come.
<string>In fact, considering what you've done for<lf>Kamura, it's a little surprising it didn't<lf>happen sooner...
<string>Just take care of yourself. If anything<lf>happens to you, then Hinoa—<lf>*ahem* Everyone will be very sad.
<string>I know, I shouldn't worry so much.<lf>But please, do take care.
<string>Hinoa seems a little sad since you left<lf>the village, <PL>.
<string>When she has something on her mind,<lf>the number of Bunny Dango she eats<lf>always increases tenfold.
<string>Me? Well, I wouldn't say I'm sad. It's<lf>more like a strange feeling of you not<lf>being where I expect to find you.
<string>The same feeling I would imagine having<lf>if the cherry trees all vanished from<lf>Kamura, you know? Like that.
<string>Oh, my Gog. I'm so embarrassed...<lf>Someone put my art on display in Elgado!<lf>Why!?
<string>Now EVERYONE will see how awful<lf>my pictures are!
<string>I asked Master Hojo to give me more<lf>lessons... But he told me not to worry<lf>and just let my creativity flow...
<string>How can I let my creativity flow when<lf>there's no talent in the reservoir!<lf>Ugh... I could cry!
<string>Welcome back, <PL>.<lf>I am so glad to see you returned safe!
<string>Don't concern yourself with me, please.<lf>Let Hinoa and the others see you're OK.
<string>Everyone here cares for you deeply,<lf><PL>.
<string>Seeing you return safely is all I need.
<string>Elgado is bursting with energy,<lf>and everyone is so kind.
<string>Traveling really isn't for me, especially<lf>that far from Kamura!
<string>But I'm starting to feel a little more at<lf>ease when I visit Elgado. I've even<lf>started having fun!
<string>That said, I'm still much more comfortable<lf>being here in the village. How about you?
<string>Word of your deeds has reached the<lf>Hunter's Guild, <PL>.<lf>Master Hojo is very pleased!
<string>The same goes for Hinoa, and Elder Fugen<lf>too. I'm sure I don't even need to<lf>mention Master Utsushi.
<string>I'm also happy, too, <PL>.<lf>To hear everyone singing your praises.<lf>It's just wonderful, isn't it?
<string>Rondine told me that Lady Fiorayne is<lf>a knight renowned for her strength and<lf>leadership in the Kingdom.
<string>But Rondine herself is quite a powerful<lf>warrior. I'm not fit to stand in either<lf>of their shadows!
<string>I don't want to presume we're the same,<lf>but I do understand what it's like to<lf>have an outstanding older sister.
<string>I've promised to eat dinner with her<lf>tonight, to talk more on that topic<lf>and hopefully get to know her better.
<string>I might have overstepped a line,<lf>extending such an invitation.<lf>I hope she likes my cooking...
<string>Master Utsushi has been making the<lf>journey to Elgado more frequently than<lf>the rest of us, as part of his duties.
<string>He saw me off as I left for Elgado,<lf>but then when I arrived he was<lf>already there!
<string>Warriors value speed, so they say.<lf>I'd expect nothing less from him.<lf>I must follow his example.
<string>Hinoa recently stumbled across Master<lf>Utsushi practicing his Zinogre impressions<lf>in the Training Area.
<string>He invited her to join him, and... Well,<lf>I can't imagine what that looked like,<lf>but she easily mastered it!
<string>He did warn her that such a skill should<lf>never be used in anger and to keep that<lf>power locked away inside...
<string>But then I secretly got her to show me...<lf>It was utterly terrifying—I mean, u-utterly<lf>amazing! That's my sister. Heh...
<string>Welcome back, <PL>.
<string>It's been a while since you left us.<lf>Have you been eating well?
<string>Hunters need a balanced and nutritious<lf>diet. Take care to eat well. Would you<lf>like to have dinner with us tonight?
<string>I'm sure Hinoa would be very happy if<lf>you joined us. And so would I.
<string>I heard Maido is going to take the exam<lf>to become a quest receptionist.
<string>She always helps me out so much,<lf>I'm hoping to repay the favor by helping<lf>her to study.
<string>I studied as hard as I could for that<lf>exam myself. My sister can read a book<lf>once and remember it all, but not me.
<string>Still, Maido told me that after all the<lf>studying I did, she was sure I'd be able<lf>to help her with anything she needs.
<string>I'm just happy to be able to help<lf>someone out, even if only a little.<lf>Whatever I can do.
<string>Welcome back, <PL>.
<string>It sounds like things have quieted down<lf>in Elgado. Enjoy a moment of respite.
<string>Master Hojo tells me every day how<lf>meeting goals is important, but resting<lf>is important too. I hear that one a lot.
<string>And looking at you, <PL>,<lf>I understand exactly what he means.
<string>My next goal is going to be resting as<lf>much as I can! I hope you'll do the same!
<string>Strive for greatness...
<string>Both Hinoa and I have full confidence<lf>in your abilities, <PL>.<lf>Continue to strive for greatness.
<string>Hinoa, too, seems not to notice her<lf>resonance with Ibushi at all anymore,<lf>like it's just any other day.
<string><PL>, through completing<lf>so many quests, you have become<lf>a prestigious hunter.
