<string>I already died once...<lf>I have nothing left to lose.
<string>Kagero!
<string>Don't...do it...
<string>You shouldn't be here.<lf>It's too dangerous.
<string>You have to turn back...<lf>Do it for me!
<string>I have to do this!
<string>This beast...this beast must be slain!
<string>Surely...you understand!?
<string>Kagero...
<string>Farewell and...
<string>...stay safe.
<string>Kagero...
<string>Thank you.
<string>For helping me make the Tea Shop...
<string>For teaching me...many important things.
<string>And for...looking out for me.
<string>Even as a baby...always...always...
<string>Lady Yomogi...
<string>Quickly, take the child and flee<lf>from this place!
<string>GRRRRAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!
<string>You are safe with me, Lady Yomogi.
<string>Now and forever more!

<string>Alright, Ace. Get ready to thrash!
