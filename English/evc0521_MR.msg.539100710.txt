<string>Hold it. Something's off...
<string>Hng!?
<string>Huh? Malzeno is not attacking us...
<string>Maybe it's still in control of itself...
<string>The Kingdom and everyone important<lf>to me were laid to waste by Malzeno.
<string>But this time our true adversary...
<string>Is not Malzeno!
<string>Our target lies elsewhere.
<string>We must destroy the Qurio...<lf>and save Malzeno!
<string>The guardian knight of peace<lf>in the Kingdom has returned.
