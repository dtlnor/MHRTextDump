<string>ZZZZzzzz...<lf>*yawn*<lf>...Oh, hey, <PL>.
<string>Heading out of Kamura, are you? Good,<lf>good, best to expand your horizons while<lf>you're still young.
<string>Because of the Rampage, we haven't had a lot<lf>of contact with the outside world. Hope this<lf>gets some new paws beating down our path!
<string>Me? I prefer my cozy siesta spots over<lf>looking for new places to curl up outside<lf>the village.
<string>Go on, now, but don't forget to come<lf>back every once in a while. We've got<lf>a few good catnaps left in us, I reckon.
<string>My work's slowed down a bit since you<lf>left. Real kind of you, meowngster, making<lf>things easier on an old Felyne like me.
<string>You surely won't find a doc like me<lf>anywhere in the Kingdom, believe<lf>you me. Heh!
<string>But ya don't need to come rushing back<lf>to Kamura if ya get scratched up out there.<lf>I'm sure royal medical care is top tier.
<string>Still, if you ever need a sympathetic<lf>ear about anything, I got two of ‘em!<lf>Come and pow-meow with me anytime.
<string>Ayame, she puts in the work, I'll tell you<lf>that for free. But I'm glad she's here in<lf>Kamura, so I can keep an eye on her.
<string>She used to hunt like a madwoman<lf>out there. And always on her own,<lf>from what I hear.
<string>She was fur-midable from the get-go,<lf>never facing real defeat, so she couldn't<lf>tell a strong foe from the cannon fodder.
<string>Her wounds are claw-ful, but if she heals<lf>up and re-learns the ropes, she'll be<lf>back on top of the hunter ranks one day!
<string>That means proper eats, proper sleep,<lf>and a bit of exercise! Easy-peasy, with a<lf>doctor like me keeping her on track, heh!
<string>Since trade has increased with the<lf>Kingdom, I managed to get my paws<lf>on a few of their medical journals.
<string>It's interesting how they practice medicine<lf>over there. Much different than anything<lf>I'm used to, that's fur sure.
<string>The way they talk about medicine<lf>is so far removed from the mentality<lf>I know—It got this ol' Felyne thinking...
<string>What if stuff that's common knowledge<lf>here is entirely un-fur-miliar to them...
<string>I bet if we put our heads together, we<lf>could make some great strides in our<lf>field! I'd better think this through...
<string>*yawn*...<lf>Mew! All this thinking's made me drowsy.<lf>Time for a little shuteye... ZZZzzz...
<string>Looking for a Wyverian doctor, are you?<lf>You must be talking about Kagero's fur-iend.<lf>I've heard quite a lot about him!
<string>A wandering herbologist with no place to<lf>call home. His technique's the real deal,<lf>you know. The stuff he makes is potent!
<string>Even a brilliant fur-sician like myself is a<lf>step or two behind him in that department.<lf>I still haven't met him yet...
<string>I think Kagero hasn't seen him for a while<lf>either. At any rate, I'll ask him if he knows<lf>where he went.
<string>I do know he was just here not too long<lf>ago dropping off supplies. Maybe Kagero<lf>knows where he was heading next.
<string>Did you get a chance to meet that doctor—<lf>Tadori, was it? Sure hope so!
<string>He's a bit pur-culiar, but he's unmatched<lf>when it comes to apothecary work. Surely<lf>a great benefit to a hunter such as yourself!
<string>That being said... You know you can<lf>always call on me if I can be of service.
<string>I don't know a thing about those<lf>monsters out in the Kingdom, but who<lf>knows? Maybe my remedies could help.
<string>Always remember, you've got a brilliant<lf>fur-sician at your beck and paw, here!<lf>Heh.
<string>*yawn*<lf>When most folks get to my age, they<lf>start waking up early in the morning.
<string>Me, I sleep early, get up early, and come<lf>here to sleep again. Something about this<lf>spot... Has a different charm from my bed.
<string>These crazy people in Kamura are<lf>all up at the crack of dawn. Freaks<lf>a Felyne out, I'm telling you.
<string>I mean sure, they go to sleep early<lf>too, so I'll call it "healthy living" and<lf>leave it at that. Either way...
<string>All the hubbub's calmed down, right? How<lf>about you plop down for a bit and have a<lf>snooze. For old...time's...sake—ZZZzzz...
<string>Hmmm, so we have an Amatsu on our paws,<lf>do we? And the one that destroyed Kagero<lf>and Yomogi's home, no less...
<string>I do hope Kagero is OK. He must be more livid<lf>than anyone could paw-sibly understand. I'll<lf>be sure to meownitor him while you're gone.
<string>The storm is gone, and so are the dark<lf>clouds, literally and figuratively. Kagero<lf>must be feeling better, as well.
<string>There can be no doubt that Kagero has you<lf>to thank for being fur-eed from the shackles<lf>of his past, <PL>.
