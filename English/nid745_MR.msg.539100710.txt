<string>A bitter wind blows...
<string>The Fierce! Impeccable timing, as usual!<lf>I have a rather annoying elder dragon to<lf>deal with that is frostbiting my last nerve...
<string><VO:SER>A <COLS RED>Velkhana</COL> to be exact. This foul creature has<lf>been turning everything around it into a frigid<lf>wasteland. It must be disposed of, posthaste!
<string>I would have gladly given it a taste of my<lf>blade, but...something urgent has come up.<lf>You know how these things go, I'm sure.
<string><VO:NOR>The other Chevaliers are quite busy, as well,<lf>so really there's no one else we have to<lf>turn to but you!
<string>So off you go then! I'm sure that you, being<lf>the Fierce Flame that you are, will have no<lf>trouble melting that frigid beast!
<string>Well then, talk to our Princess Chichae when<lf>you're ready to take on the quest! Ta-ta!
<string>An extraordinary performance!
<string>Ah, the Fierce, you're back, and in one<lf>piece even! Allow me to express my thanks<lf>for vanquishing that Velkhana!
<string>You've been absolutely unstoppable even after<lf>saving the entire Kingdom. I'm almost inclined<lf>to invite you to join the Chevaliers...
<string>Almost, but not quite! That would be<lf>quite rude to your friends over in Kamura<lf>after all. Ahahaha! *ahem*
<string>Now, <PL>, there's one other<lf>thing I'd like to inform you of.
<string>The Chevaliers have received a top-secret<lf>order from Her Majesty the Queen herself.<lf>We are to track down and investigate a monster.
<string>However, the mission is not exactly going<lf>what you'd call "swimmingly." We have yet<lf>to capture it and it may take a while.
<string>If things go south, we may have to call<lf>upon you for help. I ask that you keep<lf>this in the back of your mind.
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>Dark depression devours me!
<string>The Fierce! You've sensed my malady<lf>and come to ease my suffering! Very well.<lf>You may shoulder my noble darkness!
<string>I'm captain of the Chevaliers, as you<lf>know. That means part of my duties is<lf>managing the health of my subordinates.
<string>But I've sensed an issue recently... My<lf>troops need more sleep! The Chevaliers<lf>face collapse without more rack time!
<string>I'm planning a special sleeping draught<lf>to help them slumber soundly. And I need<lf>you to fetch the materials. Good luck!
<string>Work worthy of a knight!
<string>You completed my dark yet noble request<lf>most admirably! The Fierce indeed! Now<lf>I can complete my slumber potion.
<string>Fear not. I'll mix a draught that can<lf>knock out even the mightiest monster.<lf>They'll sing my praises for this one!
<string>As a reward, I'll teach you how to make<lf>a very special weapon. Head over to the<lf>Smithy, and make noble use of my gift.
<string>To be so bold to stand before me...<lf>you must be that "Flame of Kamura"<lf>I've heard so much about.
<string>I admire your boldness in coming to see me.
<string>You may call me Selva, a noble knight<lf>and captain of the Chevaliers.<lf>Remember this well.
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>Flame of Kamura, how fares your time<lf>in Elgado? Although not the staunchest<lf>of bases, it serves its purpose.
<string>It is the best outpost in the Kingdom.<lf>I belong to it, and there is no doubt<lf>that it is a wonderful place.
<string>You have nothing to fear. As long as<lf>my blade remains at the ready, the<lf>safety of Elgado is assured.
<string>You should be grateful Princess Chichae<lf>found the time to explain it to you.
<string>We must slay the Kingdom's monsters<lf>and vanquish Malzeno. That is the goal<lf>of all Knights of the Royal Order.
<string>However, as a Chevalier, Admiral Galleus<lf>has seen fit to entrust me with other daily<lf>duties.
<string>We have more visitors from Kamura Village.<lf>We shall treat them well, you have my word.
<string>On my honor as a Chevalier, they shall<lf>experience the true splendor of Elgado!
<string>Come now! What does it take to make<lf>the great Flame of Kamura feel at ease?
<string>Blood Orange Bishaten?<lf>How foolish...
<string>Fear not, I doubt it will put up much of<lf>a challenge for the likes of you.
<string>Reports are coming in that Kingdom<lf>monsters are on the rampage.
<string>A life absent of rules or boundaries,<lf>you would imagine you would hold life<lf>in the highest regard.
<string>But that's only if you don't infringe on<lf>others, and that's not the case with<lf>damage to the village of Kamura.
<string>Now that Admiral Galleus has given the<lf>order, Elgado shall respond with all its<lf>might. No more damage will be done.
<string>The time has finally come for you to<lf>challenge Garangolm, the first of the<lf>Three Lords!
<string>I'm sure the Flame of Kamura is up to the<lf>task. Show me what you are capable of!
<string>That look in your eyes...<lf>I see now my doubts were in vain.<lf>Now, off with you! Go sing your legacy!
<string>I have no idea what those blasted<lf>scholars are thinking.
<string>Especially Bahari. He always lets his<lf>emotions dictate his actions. It makes<lf>him unpredictable.
<string>...No, it's not that. It's not that I don't<lf>like him as a superior. It's just...<lf>well, we don't really get on so well.
<string>I commend you for all the great strides<lf>you've made in your research here in Elgado.
<string>I've heard some describe the Qurio as creepy,<lf>vile even? But I don't think so. Do they not<lf>look like they're wearing a dazzling robe?
<string>How could such a beautiful creature<lf>possibly be a threat? The natural world<lf>truly is a mysterious place.
<string>It appears Malzeno has finally made<lf>its presence known.
<string>It hear tell it controls the Qurio and<lf>wears them like a dazzling robe.
<string>Hmph, there is no such being that shines<lf>brighter than I, a Chevalier!
<string>No matter how many Malzeno come,<lf>they shall all fall before my absolute<lf>brilliance.
<string>Malzeno is not to be feared. For now, rest<lf>easy and proceed with your investigation!
<string><VO:SER>Fiorayne has collapsed?<lf>Troubling news indeed...
<string>She is a fine knight, perhaps the best<lf>in the entire Order. My thoughts and<lf>prayers are with her.
<string>I ask this is of you, Flame of Kamura.<lf>Lend her your aid so she would recover.
<string>I see, the medicine is ready. Superb!<lf>That doctor is nothing short of remarkable.
<string>I'm certain Fiorayne's recovery is underway.<lf>You have my thanks, Flame of Kamura.
<string>That doctor of yours would make an<lf>excellent addition to the Chevaliers!<lf>I shall have a word later.
<string>I'm sure he’ll be delighted to hear<lf>the captain of the Chevaliers would<lf>like to speak with him personally!
<string>At long last, Malzeno will be vanquished.<lf>Long have I yearned for this day to come.
<string>But I remain focused on my duty,<lf>for I see beyond Malzeno, to a brighter<lf>future.
<string>You can leave the rest to me.<lf>Concentrate on the task at hand,<lf>Flame of Kamura!
<string>I commend you on your splendid<lf>work vanquishing Malzeno!
<string>However, we should not let our guard down.<lf>Admiral Galleus's judgment is correct.<lf>Not everything is under control yet.
<string>Now is the time to be vigilant. Eat Bunny<lf>Dango to build your strength, and hone<lf>your skills through quests.
<string>A gloomy day lies ahead. Not even thy<lf>knightly brilliance shall brighten up this day.
<string>I, Selva of the Chevaliers, have not felt<lf>such a powerful presence before...
<string>The time has come for the Chevaliers<lf>to take the lead. Mark my words, I shall<lf>discern the source of these anomalies.
<string>I knew it, it was the work of the Devil<lf>all along! An opponent sought by us<lf>Chevaliers for some time.
<string>We hid the truth to prevent any needless<lf>confusion. Who would believe such<lf>a fairy tale in the first place?
<string>Yet we are unshaken, o’ Flame of Kamura.<lf>Look around: all of us here in Elgado<lf>believe in you, unwaveringly.
<string>Heavy are the shoulders that bear such<lf>expectation, but bear it they must.<lf>Stand tall, eyes ahead! Forward, march!
<string>Flame of Kamura! Splendid! Marvelous!<lf>Superb work!
<string>While you've yet to reach my esteemed<lf>heights, no other words would suffice.<lf>Accept my venerable praise with relish!
<string>So, too, are the populace of the Outpost<lf>rejoicing. The skies are clear, the birds<lf>are singing—you get the picture.
<string>I believe you still have some time in<lf>Elgado, yes? I shall permit you to<lf>associate with me. Go on, speak freely!
<string>I have received orders from Admiral Galleus<lf>to command the Chevaliers.
<string>The Chevaliers take on special missions<lf>from the Admiral, the secrecy of which<lf>I fear must be kept sacrosanct.
<string>Such orders from the Admiral are as<lf>splendiferous as myself. I am most<lf>proud to receive them.
<string>Are you aware of Paz, another Chevalier<lf>like myself?
<string>She is indeed the deputy commander<lf>of our unit. While inferior to myself,<lf>she possesses a modicum of talent.
<string>Her aptitude is not in question. It is<lf>just, well...during the hunt, her<lf>more...bellicose nature emerges...
<string>But no, to speak of it any further could<lf>put my life in jeopardy. Simply remember:<lf>Pazzy Poo's strength is undeniable.
<string>I am often described as "self-important."<lf>I have no interest in my own importance,<lf>even with royal blood in my veins.
<string>The throne beckons me not. A monarch<lf>is necessary to lead the people, but can<lf>a throne wield a sword for said people?
<string>To protect the monarch is to protect the<lf>Kingdom; thus have I become a knight,<lf>and thus do I serve in this capacity.
<string>I always watch over the people of Elgado<lf>from here. Despite that...
<string>Never do they approach me for discourse<lf>outside the scope of Chevalier missions.
<string>Why? I, lover and protector of the people,<lf>stand right here by the Quest Gate, and yet...
<string>...Ah, but of course! My nobility shines<lf>too brightly for them to comfortably<lf>approach!
<string>Nothing to be done about it then, I fear.<lf>Permit them I must, to bask in my<lf>brilliance from afar!
<string>Sir Jae has demonstrated quite the<lf>aptitude, despite his relative<lf>inexperience.
<string>More than anything, he comes to converse<lf>with me—albeit infrequently. What a show<lf>of respect! A fine fellow, indeed.
<string>He may resemble Admiral Galleus externally<lf>with that hairstyle, but an esteem for me<lf>dwells within, believe you me.
<string>People are naturally drawn to me, despite<lf>a lack of contribution on my part. This<lf>charm of mine is troublesome, indeed!
<string>The other day, I went personally to<lf>invite the brilliant doctor into the<lf>hallowed ranks of the Chevaliers.
<string>Nevertheless, he turned me down!<lf>It would seem he cares more for his<lf>work in the field.
<string>Accumulating knowledge through such<lf>on-site labor made him the man he is<lf>today. What splendid, unflagging effort!
<string>I shall remain here in Elgado for the<lf>foreseeable future. Surely the heavens<lf>are on my side!
<string>For I have been given the chance to yet<lf>persuade the brilliant doctor! I won't<lf>let this opportunity go to waste!
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>Please, hear my plea!
<string>The Fierce! Do you know of Gore Magala?<lf>Many have seen this dark shadow of late.<lf>The Kingdom faces a new threat!
<string>Documents left by some kind of hunting<lf>caravan also speak of its dire nature.<lf>As a Chevalier, I must act!
<string>Normally I would turn my shining sword<lf>against it in a flash, but my noble<lf>duties as captain bind me to this place!
<string>The Fierce! You see where this is going?<lf>I need you to capture me a Gore Magala!<lf>I know you have the mettle for this task!
<string>My most noble thanks!
<string>A Knight in all but name! You have<lf>completed my task soundly, and aided<lf>our investigations into Gore Magala.
<string>Your reward is the formula for some<lf>special gear, also found among the<lf>documents. Huzzah! To the Smithy!
<string>As captain of the Chevaliers, I'm often<lf>unable to act swiftly. But with your aid,<lf>Fierce, we have nothing to fear!
