<string>Come now, let us depart!
<string><NOFAC>Greetings, <PL>. How are you<lf>faring? I am grateful for all that you<lf>have done. Yet...
<string>Forgive me for asking more from you,<lf>but perhaps you will humble my request.<lf>Might you go hunting with me again?
<string>As I revealed to you before, my sister and<lf>I are both knights of the Order. In short,<lf>we are able hunters.
<string>But of course I had to feign my presence<lf>here as a trader. I quite understand<lf>that you might not believe me.
<string>Now that the need for pretense is no<lf>more, I would like to demonstrate my<lf>skill on a quest with you.
<string>I'm sure that once you see me in action,<lf>you will have no trouble believing that I too<lf>am a hunter. I do hope you'll accept.
<string>That was a great help!
<string><NOFAC>Thank you for accepting the quest.<lf>So, now that you have witnessed my skill,<lf>what do you think of me as a hunter?
<string>The truth is, I did occasionally and<lf>covertly "borrow" the Training Area. But<lf>still, my instincts have been dulled.
<string>Hmm...<lf>More training is the only answer.
<string>Forgive me for asking, but I would<lf>very much like to quest together again.
<string>Oh, I nearly forgot. I wanted to give<lf>you this by way of thanks. I trust<lf>you will find it useful.
<string>Come now, let us depart!
<string><NOFAC>I do appreciate your help with that<lf>little warming-up exercise before.
<string>...It's crass of me to ask having just<lf>thanked you, I know, but could we quest<lf>together again?
<string>Our last excursion helped me recover<lf>some of my instincts, but I still don't<lf>feel fully at ease.
<string>Forgive me for asking so much, but<lf>I would very much like to accompany<lf>you again.
<string>I shall issue a new quest, and I'd be<lf>delighted if you were to accept it.
<string>Thank you!
<string><NOFAC>Ah, greetings.<lf>I'm most grateful for your help before.<lf>I feel fully restored at last.
<string>Nevertheless, I...<lf>Well, I wonder if you would care to join<lf>me on further quests?
<string>Previously, I had to stay myself so as<lf>not to worry Her Majesty. But things are<lf>different now.
<string>I asked Her Majesty again and I was<lf>given permission, provided my role<lf>is that of an assistant.
<string>So, with apologies for how late this is,<lf>allow me to offer my assistance to you!
<string>Come now, let us depart!
<string><NOFAC>Greetings <PL>, I've received<lf>a message from some trading friends of mine.<lf>It appears they been attacked by a monster.
<string>I was just in the process of issuing<lf>a quest to resolve the situation.
<string>And I thought a person of your talents<lf>would be perfect for the job. Will you<lf>take it on with me?
<string>Those traders have always been very<lf>good to me and I'd like to do what I can<lf>to help them.
<string>I am sorry to bring my troubles to your<lf>door, but I really could benefit from<lf>your assistance.
<string>Your assistance has been invaluable!
<string><NOFAC>Ah, Hunter. Thank you for accepting my<lf>request. I've received word that the traders<lf>have safely arrived at their destination.
<string>It turns out that they were transporting<lf>Bunny Dango ingredients at the time,<lf>I'm sure that our Hinoa is relieved.
<string>Now, since it was I who called upon<lf>your aid, I have personally prepared<lf>your reward.
<string>I hope you shall find it useful.
<string>Ready to embark on your new journey?<lf>As soon as you've finished saying your<lf>goodbyes, let my sister know.
<string>The Outpost is somewhat of a journey<lf>from here, but rest assured, you shall<lf>always have safe passage.
<string>I can only apologize for this inconvenience.<lf>...And hope to make things as easy as<lf>possible for you.
<string>Greetings. It's been a while. I trust things<lf>are going well in Elgado?
<string>I've heard this is your first experience<lf>outside of Kamura. Please speak with<lf>my sister should any issue arise.
<string>Under normal circumstances, a hero such<lf>as yourself would have received an invitation<lf>to visit from our beloved Kingdom.
<string>It's a pity the situation calls for such<lf>urgency. But at the very least, it will<lf>acquaint you with the outside world.
<string>I regret that our problems are affecting<lf>you this way. So if any personal gain<lf>comes of it for you, I would be glad.
<string>Kamura's cherry blossoms are truly<lf>spectacular.
<string>I've been in the village for some time<lf>now. I've grown rather fond of it.
<string>As a result, when I visit Elgado<lf>it looks, well...rather drab in<lf>comparison.
<string>Still, Elgado is merely an outpost.<lf>It doesn't warrant flowers, really.
<string>All the same, those posted there for an<lf>extended period would feel rejuvenated<lf>by such beautiful flowers, I'm sure.
<string>It's Hanamori who tends the flowers,<lf>isn't it? Perhaps I'll consult with him.
<string><VO:SER>My sister is a knight of some renown in<lf>the Kingdom. She shines even among<lf>her elite peers.
<string>She's proved herself time and again,<lf>and Her Majesty has great faith in her.<lf>I'm rightly proud of her achievements.
<string>But when it comes to handling a sword,<lf>I refuse to be second best.
<string>Of course, of the two of us, my sister<lf>is the obvious "knight." She has the<lf>composure and the technical skill.
<string>However, my tenacity never lets me<lf>down. Which is why I strive to excel<lf>in any task I'm given.
<string><VO:SER>My sister is a woman of action, and will<lf>stop at nothing to achieve her goals.
<string>Do you remember what my sister said<lf>in front of the Steelworks? "We shall<lf>lay down our lives for the cause..."
<string>I believe one of the reasons Elder Fugen<lf>sent you to Elgado is because he sensed<lf>the danger in those words.
<string>As a result, you and the Admiral have<lf>helped my sister be more cautious,<lf>but in the end it still wasn't enough...
<string>She did the right thing as a knight, to put<lf>others over herself. But still, as her sister,<lf>it's... Well, it's a difficult issue.
<string>Ah, you've returned, I see.
<string>My sister has made a full recovery,<lf>thanks to you, and I have resumed<lf>my usual duties.
<string>I am most grateful for everything<lf>you've done.
<string>Perhaps you've heard these words<lf>countless times, but how can we<lf>ever repay you?
<string>Naturally, Her Majesty has been informed<lf>of the situation. But my sister and I must<lf>make a personal report, as well.
<string>Thanks to your tireless efforts,<lf>it seems these troubles will<lf>soon be behind us.
<string>And the bond forged between Kamura<lf>Village and the Kingdom will persist<lf>long into the future.
<string>It's not just the knights garrisoned in<lf>Elgado. All knights of the Royal Order<lf>now have a deep interest in Kamura.
<string>Oh yes, even Princess Chichae asked to<lf>accompany me next time I visit.
<string>Of course, nothing would make me happier<lf>than to grant the princess's wishes, but<lf>it's not so simple to arrange her passage.
<string>I believe our newest Elgado Smithy<lf>has received some training from<lf>Master Hamon the other day.
<string>Chino especially worked very hard. At<lf>this very moment, Kamura technique is<lf>being conveyed throughout the Kingdom.
<string>Which means I've finally been able<lf>to reveal my true purpose here. An<lf>enormous weight has been lifted...
<string>Despite my lies and deception, I've been<lf>met with nothing but kindness.
<string>And I certainly never dreamed that<lf>you would share your hitherto secret<lf>forging knowledge willingly.
<string>I shan't forget this generosity for as long<lf>as I live. On behalf of the entire Kingdom<lf>and the Royal Order, I thank you.
<string>I was hoping to be stationed in Elgado<lf>alongside my sister. But Her Majesty<lf>refused...
<string>I have a different assignment now.<lf>To work with the people of the village<lf>and investigate the surrounding area.
<string>This crisis originated in my land. And<lf>since it is the Kingdom requesting<lf>help, I vow to do all I can to help.
<string>It pains me deeply to burden you and<lf>your village with our troubles, but we<lf>need your help.
<string>I've repeatedly invited Hinoa and<lf>the others to accompany me on<lf>excursions outside the village.
<string>But each time, Hinoa has refused because,<lf>and I quote, she "won't go anywhere that<lf>doesn't have Bunny Dango."
<string>I should have persuaded her by saying<lf>she could bring dango with her, I suppose...
<string>And if Hinoa agreed, I imagine Minoto<lf>would have come as well. Hmph.<lf>I really should have thought of that.
<string>Anyway, it's wonderful that they've<lf>had the chance to explore beyond<lf>the village boundaries now.
<string>It seems Hinoa is enjoying her time in<lf>Elgado. I'm very pleased.
<string>Minoto, on the other hand, still seems<lf>to be finding her feet. But she assures<lf>me it's not that she doesn't like it.
<string>Still, Elgado is nothing more than an<lf>outpost. I look forward to inviting them<lf>to see the capital.
<string>And you must come, too. I would stake<lf>the good name of the Royal Order on<lf>the reception you'll enjoy.
<string>Komitsu has a feverish appetite for<lf>knowledge about the outside world.
<string>However, Elder Fugen said she was too<lf>young to travel to Elgado now.
<string>I considered taking full responsibility<lf>for her safety, but she's determined<lf>to be able to look after herself.
<string>I shall watch her development with<lf>interest. She's a fine and surprisingly<lf>capable citizen of Kamura.
<string>I've no doubt that before long she'll<lf>find her own way to new places.<lf>Haha, I look forward to it.
<string>Trading was nothing more than<lf>a pretense so I could infiltrate<lf>the village.
<string>But in truth, I've found it fascinating<lf>and extremely instructive. And bringing<lf>goods to enrich lives is most rewarding.
<string>Of course, as a knight of the Order,<lf>my duty is to follow Her Majesty's<lf>instructions to the letter.
<string>Still, trade is a fine thing. The best<lf>inventions from all regions spread,<lf>bringing monetary and cultural wealth.
<string>Perhaps somehow I could combine<lf>trading and my knightly duties. I must<lf>consult with Admiral Galleus...
<string>I have been informed that you and Master<lf>Utsushi are setting out to slay an Amatsu<lf>together. This shall be no easy task.
<string>The Kingdom would extend a helping hand,<lf>but the Anomaly is growing ever stronger,<lf>and we do not have the resources to spare.
<string>I assure you the Kingdom, and my sister<lf>especially, are extremely frustrated with<lf>this "situation." I pray for your safe return.
<string>Splendid job, Hunter! And good to see<lf>Kagero has returned to the village in<lf>one piece, as well.
<string>He disappeared almost as soon as you set<lf>out. It wasn't long before Yomogi came to<lf>seek my aid.
<string>She told me she wanted to go wherever<lf>Amatsu was, so I sent her there in my<lf>fastest and sturdiest ship.
<string>She instinctively knew to come to me for<lf>a ship that would be able to brave the storm.<lf>She's a smart one. Reminds me of our Chichae.
<string>I'm sure you're well aware by now that<lf>the Kingdom is facing its biggest threat<lf>yet.
<string>But if we manage to overcome this threat,<lf>we may finally put a stop to the fatal ties<lf>between Malzeno and the Kingdom.
<string>True peace is drawing close for both Kamura<lf>and the Kingdom. And it's all thanks to you!
<string>I am truly honored and grateful I was able<lf>to meet you and everyone in this lovely<lf>village. May our people continue to prosper!
<string><VO:SER>Well then. This is meant only for you:
<string><VO:SER>Well then. This is meant only for you:
