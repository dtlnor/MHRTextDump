<string>I heard you're heading to the Kingdom's<lf>outpost. And also, I heard they even<lf>asked for you by name. I'm impressed!
<string>You know, I've been to the Kingdom before.<lf>Once. As a hunter, of course.
<string>If I remember correctly, everyone calls<lf>hunters out there "knights." And they're<lf>not just any Joe Shmoe either.
<string>The knights commanded by the queen<lf>are a cut above the rest. Rigorously<lf>trained and remarkably skillful.
<string>You'll be hunting among the cream of the<lf>crop. A fantastic experience, indeed. Do<lf>your best—within reason, of course.
<string>Oh, <PL>.<lf>Welcome back. It's good to see you.
<string>How's hunts over in the Kingdom? This<lf>is your first time outside Kamura, right?<lf>Must take some getting used to.
<string>That takes me back... I remember when<lf>I first left, nothing made sense to me.<lf>I felt like I woke up every day confused.
<string>Nothing wrong with a little confusion<lf>now and then. Take the opportunity,<lf>have a little fun with it.
<string>And if that confusion leads to some<lf>good stories, I'd be more than happy<lf>to hear them.
<string>How's it going, <PL>?
<string>I hear from Master Utsushi that you've<lf>been a busy hunter out in the wild.
<string>Every chance he gets, it's, "Ace<lf>did this," and "Ace did that." He's<lf>so proud of his "favorite pupil."
<string>That's a good master you've got there.<lf>Though as his student, I imagine it<lf>must have been a bit suffocating.
<string>Well, keep up the good work out there.<lf>Just don't push yourself too hard, you<lf>hear me?
<string>Don't want your master worrying about<lf>you. Heh.
<string><VO:SER>Is it true, <PL>?<lf>Malzeno has appeared?
<string>I heard the last time it appeared, it<lf>wreaked havoc all across the Kingdom.
<string>...And now it's back. I hope it can be<lf>dealt with before it can do it again.<lf>You be careful out there.
<string><VO:SER>I heard Rondine's sister got hurt.<lf>Is she OK!?
<string>As you can imagine, I know exactly<lf>how she feels. I'm sure she'll be back<lf>in action in no time.
<string>At any rate, it's clear that Malzeno<lf>is as fearsome as they say. Don't<lf>get reckless out there, you hear me?
<string>I heard Rondine's sister—Fiorayne,<lf>was it?—is making a speedy recovery.<lf>Good news, indeed.
<string>Still, any recklessness could cause her<lf>condition to deteriorate. And not to sound<lf>like a broken record, you be careful too.
<string>I'm sorry... I find it difficult to keep my<lf>thoughts to myself on the matter, given<lf>my own history.
<string>Makes me happy to hear about her return.<lf>It's encouraging, you know? I should get<lf>back to working on my own. Heh.
<string>Welcome back, <PL>.<lf>You defeated Gaismagorm? That's...<lf>That's incredible! YOU'RE incredible!
<string>It's crazy enough that a monster from<lf>a fairy tale actually exists, but then<lf>you go and slay the thing!? Wow...
<string>You keep accomplishing so much<lf>while I'm stuck here with this injury...
<string>But don't you think for a single minute<lf>that it's gonna stay this way. I'm just<lf>congratulating a job well done.
<string>Just think of it as a li'l head start 'cause<lf>once I'm fully recovered, I'm gonna be<lf>hot on your heels! You hear me? Haha!
<string>First the Rampage, then the trouble in<lf>the Kingdom, and now ANOTHER calamity?<lf>When it rains, it pours, huh?
<string>It may feel like the darkness never ends,<lf>but morning will always come. So you just<lf>gotta keep going. Good luck out there!
<string>So you took down Amatsu, too? Well,<lf>I guess I shouldn't even be surprised<lf>anymore.
<string>Surf ninja over there won't shut up about it.<lf>He's been yappin' about how "gnarly" you<lf>were ever since he got back.
<string>Guess I can't really complain, the man<lf>is proud of you...as we all are. Anyway,<lf>congrats.
