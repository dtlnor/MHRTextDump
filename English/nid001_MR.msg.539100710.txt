<string>Monsters invadin' Kamura, huh? Head on<lf>over to the Ruins and check things out.
<string>Minoto should have everything ready<lf>to go for ya! We're counting on you,<lf>Squirt. Now go get to it!
<string>Who woulda thunk the Kingdom Outpost<lf>would be the next stage for your adventures!
<string>Ain't enough hours in the day to explain<lf>how often you've saved our skins. I bet<lf>you'll put on quite a show over there.
<string>Well, off you go, then! Show 'em<lf>just how bright that flame in your<lf>gut burns!
<string>This here's an official collaboration<lf>with Elgado. Even got an awful nice<lf>letter from their Admiral Galleus!
<string>From what I can tell and from what<lf>I've heard, he seems like a fine leader.<lf>I'm sure he'll take good care of ya!
<string>Anyway, I'd love to go and meet him<lf>myself, but we got our parts to play—<lf>and on opposite sides of the stage.
<string>I sent a letter back, of course, but if you<lf>could give him a hello from me, I'd much<lf>appreciate it. Well, go get investigatin'!
<string>Monsters evolve to suit the land they<lf>inhabit.
<string>That's why the ones from the Kingdom<lf>are so different from the monsters 'round<lf>here.
<string>Doesn't matter though. Kamura monsters,<lf>Kingdom monsters... They're all no match<lf>for you! Now go get to it! Bwahaha!
<string>No matter where you go, monsters<lf>are always gonna be a threat. That's<lf>just the way it is.
<string>Just like our drawn-out struggle with<lf>the Rampage, the Kingdom has their<lf>own mess to deal with.
<string>Seein' how that fire inside ya saved Kamura,<lf>I bet they could use a little bit of that fire<lf>over there in Elgado.
<string>We're countin' on you, Squirt.
<string><VO:SER>I heard about what happened to Fiorayne.<lf>Any word on her recuperatin'?
<string>Can't imagine what Fiorayne must be<lf>goin' through. I'm sure Rondine is<lf>worried sick.
<string>If there's anything we can do for 'em<lf>you let us know! Kamura'll give it all<lf>we've got!
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> nid001_base4_005
<string>Fiorayne's back on her feet!<lf>That's good to hear!
<string>Now you can take on ol' Malzeno<lf>with a clear mind.
<string>To the Kingdom, Malzeno is more of<lf>a calamity than a monster. But to you,<lf>it's just another notch on your belt!
<string>Bwahaha! *ahem* We're countin' on ya,<lf>Squirt! Good luck!
<string>A Kamura Hunter, takin' down the<lf>Kingdom's nemesis! Never thought<lf>I'd see the day! And to think...
<string>I watched you grow from a li'l Squirt into<lf>the fine warrior you are today. It's enough<lf>to make an ol' man misty-eyed. *sniff*
<string>And as we speak, you're bein' hailed far<lf>and wide across the Kingdom as a hero<lf>and a savior!
<string>I tell ya, I couldn't be prouder. I'm sure<lf>everyone in Kamura feels the same way.
<string>Bwahaha! Welcome back, Squirt!<lf>Everybody's been waitin' for ya!
<string>We all know how tough you are...<lf>But going up against something<lf>like that!
<string>Everyone's been prayin' for your safe return...<lf>And now here you are, safe and sound!<lf>Well done, Squirt, well done.
<string>Why not relax a little, take a load off.<lf>You earned it.
<string>There were a few frowny faces when<lf>word spread you're leaving us, but<lf>your strength ain't for the village alone.
<string>The world is vast; all the things you<lf>come across out there are sure to help<lf>spread those wings of yours even further.
<string>Hunting at the outpost of a great nation<lf>like the Kingdom is a once-in-a-lifetime<lf>opportunity.
<string>So whatcha waiting for,<lf><PL>? Go on, stoke that <lf>spirit of yours into a raging flame!
<string>Well look what the Felyne dragged in!<lf>How's things goin' out in Elgado, Squirt?<lf>I tell ya, Utsushi's been worried sick!
<string>I'm surprised he hadn't snuck off to keep<lf>an eye on you— What's that? You keep<lf>seein' him in Elgado? Bwahahaha!
<string>That man, I swear! Well, ya can't blame<lf>him. Every one of us miss ya dearly.<lf>Especially us ol' folks! Bwahahaha!
<string>Kamura's chock-full of talented folks;<lf>we trained ourselves, body and soul, in<lf>anticipation of the Rampage.
<string>But we ain't the only ones. I'm sure there's<lf>a hundred Squirts out there, if not more!<lf>Trained in ways we couldn't even imagine.
<string>You're still wet behind the ears, Squirt.<lf>Learn everything ya can, see how far<lf>that strength of yours can go.
<string>Life's not certain, but one thing is!<lf>I'm havin' a ball watchin' you handle<lf>business out there! Bwahahaha!
<string>Since you went off to Elgado, a few<lf>others have been makin' regular trips<lf>back and forth.
<string>I tell ya, it's been great to see. I ain't<lf>seen so many comings and goings<lf>since I was a boy.
<string>But it ain't all fun and games, of course.<lf>We've still got all these Kingdom monsters<lf>to deal with...
<string>But hey, I imagine this'll be the start<lf>of some steady trade with the Kingdom,<lf>once everything's all wrapped up here.
<string>Just another thing to add to the pile.<lf>I must've said it a hundred times already,<lf>but we're countin' on ya! Now go get to it!
<string>You know Squirt, some days I'm just blown<lf>away at just how fast you grow! Now don't<lf>get all embarrassed! Bwahaha! *ahem*
<string>Ol' Hoj, was right on the zenny about you!<lf>His keen eyes don't lie.
<string>He's recognized your talents long before<lf>you became a hunter—always polishin',<lf>sometimes beatin' you into shape.
<string>Ol' Hojo watched over you, an' always<lf>believed in you. Don't matter where you<lf>go, that'll never change. Bwahahaha!
<string>Good to have ya back in Kamura, Squirt!<lf>I hear you've been tearin' it up over in<lf>Elgado!
<string>The great flame of Kamura Village,<lf>climbing high enough to scorch the<lf>very heavens! Bwahaha! *ahem*
<string>All the villagers just itchin' to hear<lf>about your tour de force. Heck, even<lf>the one you're looking at.
<string>Well, it ain't every day we get to revel<lf>in your return. Give the others eyeful<lf>of that spunky mug of yours!
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>Got a job for ya!
<string>I see that fire inside ya is blazin' brighter<lf>than ever. And it's got the whole village<lf>burnin' with excitement. Good work!
<string>So, in recognition of all you've done, I've gone<lf>and prepared a little somethin' for ya! But I<lf>gotta see if you're ready for it, first!
<string>SO, I arranged a little test for ya. A quest<lf>to throw down with some real heavy<lf>hitters in the Shrine Ruins.
<string>Ol' Hoj was croakin' about wastin' your<lf>talents, but indulge an ol' man, will ya?<lf>Besides, it'll be good fun! Bwahahaha!
<string>*ahem* Anyway, with your skills and all<lf>the new things you've learned, it should<lf>be a walk in the park! Now, go get to it!
<string>We've got huntin' to do,<lf><PL>!
<string>Come on, Squirt! Time for us to get to it!
<string>BWAHAHAHA!<lf>I finally get to say it!
<string>It took a little "convincin'," but I finally got<lf>Hinoa to register us a quest! Bwahaha!<lf>Never underestimate the power of dango!
<string>Anyway, I can't tell ya how long I've been<lf>waitin' for this day!
<string>I may be an elder, but the fire still<lf>burns bright inside my gut! Hope<lf>you're ready! Now, let's go get to it!
<string>Now that's what I'm talkin' about!
<string>Squirt, you make the whole dang village<lf>proud. And thank you, that was exactly<lf>what this ol' hunter needed.
<string>And I've been meanin' to check out your<lf>huntin' skills, but with the Rampage and<lf>all, I never could get a chance.
<string>But I tell ya, you're a true Kamura Hunter,<lf>Squirt! And I can't wait to go out huntin'<lf>with ya again!
<string>Whenever you're not savin' the Kingdom<lf>from calamity, let's go out again some time!
<string><PL>!<lf>Time for us to get to it!
<string>Perfect timing, Squirt!
<string>Apparently something's been tearin' up<lf>the Lava Caverns. And that somethin'<lf>is Magnamalo. However...
<string>It would seem from the damage done and<lf>eyewitness reports that we're actually<lf>dealing with two big boys!
<string>Sounds like this is a good chance to go<lf>out and give 'em a proper Kamura welcome!<lf>Whaddaya say, Squirt!? Bwahahaha!
<string>Now that's what I'm talkin' about!
<string>Good work out there, Squirt!<lf>Can't say it enough, but you<lf>truly are a fine Kamura Hunter!
<string>Squirt, I tell ya! I feel alive! Reminds me<lf>of back in the day with ol' Ham and Hoj...
<string>But as much as I'd like to keep relivin' those<lf>glory days, I can't leave Kamura leaderless<lf>while I'm out pretendin' I'm still young.
<string>But don't let that stop ya from invitin' me!
<string>I'm already lookin' forward to our next hunt!<lf>Bwahahaha!
