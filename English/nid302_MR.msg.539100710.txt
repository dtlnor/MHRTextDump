<string>Hi, <PL>.<lf>Have you finished packing? You're going<lf>to that Kingdom outpost right?
<string>I've never been outside the village at all.<lf>It must be scary going to live someplace<lf>new...
<string>I hope it goes OK. Take care!
<string>You're taking your Buddies with you,<lf>right? Look after them, won't you?
<string>I heard that the Kingdom is using<lf>Palamutes now. I bet you'll even<lf>see them in Elgado.
<string>Elder Fugen and Inukai told me it was<lf>my parents who first introduced Canynes<lf>to the Kingdom.
<string>My grandfather was there when they<lf>told me, but he just frowned and said,<lf>"Oh."
<string>I thought he was angry, but Elder Fugen<lf>said he was just embarrassed. Something<lf>about "not taking the compliment."
<string>I never know what Grandpa's thinking.<lf>Does this mean he's OK with Buddies<lf>now? If so, that would be amazing!
<string>Hi, <PL>!<lf>Welcome back home. You look like<lf>you're doing great.
<string>How are your Buddies? You know,<lf>if you're having any trouble with them,<lf>I'd be glad to help.
<string>But Nagi, who runs the Buddy Piazza<lf>is just as knowledgeable about Buddies,<lf>if not more so!
<string>He always hated hunting, so he seemed<lf>kind of unsure of himself. But for the<lf>Buddy Piazza, he's perfect.
<string>Mind you, he must be pretty lonely out<lf>there. He went out there all by himself...
<string>Maybe you could go say hi once<lf>in a while, <PL>?
<string>I thought my parents were gonna be able<lf>to come back for a visit, but not with those<lf>Kingdom monsters on the loose...
<string>Apparently, my grandfather sent them<lf>a message telling them to hold off on<lf>coming back for a while...
<string>So I was thinking... If I could become<lf>stronger, maybe I could go visit them.
<string>It's not like I'm super lonely or<lf>anything, it's just that I haven't seen<lf>them for so long now.
<string>And if my skills improve I can also use<lf>them to protect Kamura, too!
<string>Welcome back, <PL>.<lf>Sounds like you've been doing great<lf>things in Elgado.
<string>...Hm? How do I know?<lf>Well, because Master Utsushi<lf>tells us all about it.
<string>He does monster impressions and<lf>everything. It's a real performance.<lf>All the Buddies love it!
<string>He's really amazing, isn't he?
<string>I mean, he trains Taishi, run errands for<lf>Elder Fugen and Master Hojo, and he's<lf>doing stuff in Elgado, too...
<string>It's like he's really three different people.<lf>Wait... There's only one of him, right?
<string>Welcome back, <PL>.<lf>The Buddies knew you'd show up soon.<lf>They've all been really restless.
<string>We're all dying to hear the news from<lf>Elgado. Or rather, we're dying to hear<lf>about your heroic deeds.
<string>I mean, Master Utsushi has probably told<lf>us everything already, but it's not as good<lf>as hearing it from the Kirin's mouth!
<string>Have you got some time now?<lf>I'd love to hear a story if you got one!
<string>All the Buddies here are training<lf>really hard to help hunters out in<lf>the field.
<string>So they all love hearing stories from<lf>you hunters about your adventures.
<string>It'd be amazing if you could take some<lf>time to visit once in a while and tell<lf>them about what you've been up to.
<string>I'd really like it, too.
<string>Rondine gave me this strange tool<lf>for cleaning the Toadversary.
<string>It looks like a mop with a super long<lf>handle. She said she got it for Shirubei<lf>because she noticed him having trouble.
<string>I guess it's hard cleaning something<lf>so tall. But then again, I never realized<lf>because he keeps it so clean.
<string>Either way, he was really pleased! Kinda<lf>neat to use something that's not from<lf>Kamura! Oh! I should show my grandfather!
<string>Rondine is really kind, isn't she?<lf>I'll have to talk to Shirubei and come<lf>up with some way to repay her.
<string>Minayle is in Elgado now, right?<lf>For a little while she was training<lf>under my grandfather.
<string>She came to see the Toadversary, too.<lf>And she told me what a great job I was<lf>doing training the Buddies.
<string>She also told me that it was MY parents<lf>who introduced Palamutes to the Kingdom!
<string>I was shocked, but I'm also so proud! And<lf>according to her, Palamutes are standard<lf>companions among the Royal Order now!
<string>Tetsy just refuses to accept anyone<lf>but Master Hojo.
<string>I mean, I'm usually pretty confident about<lf>befriending Felynes and Canynes, but<lf>I can't crack that one.
<string>Just once, she let me climb up on her<lf>back, but only because I was with Master<lf>Hojo. I wish we could be friends...
<string>But Master Hojo warned me about pushing<lf>it. He said she might end up hurting me<lf>and then we'd both feel bad.
<string>I don't want that. It would be awful.<lf>I think I'll just try giving her the odd<lf>dango for now.
<string>You know, Mihaba often brings dango for<lf>the Buddies. That guy is so crazy about<lf>Hinoa he uses all his zenny on dango!
<string>And you know how much Hinoa eats<lf>dango. I'm surprised he has any left<lf>to bring to the Buddies! Hehehe.
<string>Either way, the Buddies all love him<lf>because of it.
<string>Kinda feels like he's my older brother<lf>sometimes...
<string>B-But that would make Mihaba my<lf>grandfather's grandson, too. Haha,<lf>that would be weird...
<string>Thanks to all the stories you, Hinoa, and<lf>the others have told us about Elgado,<lf>more people are wanting to explore.
<string>I mean, I'm kinda interested in seeing<lf>what it's like outside the village, too.<lf>I don't know what I could do, though.
<string>My parents travel around promoting<lf>Palamutes, but I don't think that's for<lf>me, you know?
<string>I feel like I'm better suited looking after<lf>all the Buddies here.
<string>But I still would love to go on vacation<lf>with my parents and visit some new<lf>and interesting places!
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>Hey, got some good news!
<string>Oh, <PL>. Great timing!
<string>Watching you go off on all these exciting<lf>new adventures has the Buddies itching<lf>to get in on some action themselves.
<string>They've been putting everything they've<lf>got into their training so now they're<lf>stronger than ever!
<string>I'm sure they'd be a big help on your hunts.<lf>They're only restless here anyway. Why not<lf>take one of them out in the field with you?
