<string>Lend me a hand!
<string><NOFAC>Hey, hey! Thanks for swinging by! Like<lf>Admiral Galleus said, Chichae has some<lf><COLS RED>Anomaly Quests</COL> for you to take care of.
<string>Your mission and the primary purpose of<lf>these quests is to keep afflicted monsters<lf>in check.
<string>But I have my own mission. And that's to<lf>find out how the Qurio affect the biology<lf>of these monsters.
<string>And to do that, we've decided to use<lf>this facility to conduct official research.<lf>Welcome to the <COLS RED>Anomaly Research Lab</COL>!
<string>The Lab will start posting special quests<lf>called <COLS RED>Anomaly Investigations</COL>. Completing<lf>them will help further our research.
<string>Research is going smoothly, thanks to<lf>you and yours, <PL>.<lf>Still, the mysteries are abound.
<string>I've already given Chichae the first Anomaly<lf>Investigation. Go check it out when you're<lf>done here. OK, Team Elgado! Let's get it!
<string>Lend me a hand!

<string>Welp, eyewitness accounts of afflicted<lf>monsters are pouring in. And while we're up<lf>to our elbows in work here, we still lack data...

<string>We've had numerous reports of sightings<lf>of afflicted monsters. Research is going<lf>well, but we've still got plenty to do!

<string>Thanks for your help!
<string>Thanks for gettin' the ball rollin' on those<lf>investigations! Looks like there's more<lf>available, too. Good, good!
<string>Each Investigation will have different<lf>content, so try out as many as you can!<lf>Remember: The more data, the better!
<string>By the way, did you get some <COLS RED>Investigation<lf>Coins</COL>? Heeeeeey! Just a li'l something<lf>something from me to say thanks.
<string>You can use 'em here to exchange for items!<lf>And as our research progresses, more items<lf>will become available. Oh, and one more thing...
<string>Priority monsters will be posted as Research<lf>Requests. Keep an eye on those, as they'll<lf>rotate regularly. Well, thanks again!
<string>I have news!
<string>Thanks to Team Elgado's MVP—that's you—<lf>our afflicted monster research is progressin'<lf>at a nice steady pace!
<string>Looks like it's time to up the ante!<lf>Let's see how you handle <COLS RED>A5★</COL> quests!
<string>Now, there's some quests in that list that<lf>are pretty crazy, but I'm sure you'll be just<lf>fine. After all, you're our MVP!
<string>Chichae has all the information, go check<lf>'em out when you're ready. Thanks and<lf>keep up the good work!
<string>I have news!
<string><NOFAC>Alright, alright! Thanks to all your hard work,<lf>our Anomaly research is moving right along!<lf>BIG thanks! AND...
<string>We have some new Anomaly Research quests<lf>for ya! That's right! <COLS RED>A6★</COL> quests are now up<lf>for grabs!
<string>These are some pretty crazy quests,<lf>but nothing our MVP can't handle, right?<lf>Chichae already has the info.
<string>And speakin' of info, we're startin' to see<lf>real results from our research. I've already<lf>got some new stuff worked out!
<string>I was talkin' to Minayle about it, and her<lf>eyes just lit up! Think she's got something<lf>for ya! You should go talk to her!
<string>Now, I know you're puttin' in work out there,<lf>and I appreciate it! But don't forget to eat<lf>and make sure you're gettin' plenty of rest!
<string>Got some news for ya!
<string><NOFAC>Sup! Thanks to you we're making non-stop<lf>progress on our afflicted monster research!<lf>Much appreciated!
<string>And progress waits for no one! That's why<lf>I've decided to add <COLS RED>A7★</COL> quests! Mmmhmm!<lf>Whatcha think 'bout that!?
<string>Go talk to Chichae when you wanna take<lf>a crack at 'em! Remember: We're countin'<lf>on ya!
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>Risen from the grave, huh?
<string><NOFAC>Sup, <PL>?<lf>We've got ourselves a...slightly sticky<lf>situation, here.
<string>We've just found evidence that some monsters<lf>have overcome the effects of the Anomaly.<lf>Which in itself is another, uh, anomaly...
<string>And just like Malzeno and Gaismagorm before<lf>them, they've formed a symbiotic relationship<lf>with the Qurio. Crazy, right?
<string>I mean, they're basically back from the grave.<lf>Being afflicted with the Anomaly was, for the<lf>most part, a death sentence for monsters...
<string>But now these monsters have <COLS RED>Risen</COL>...<lf>And to make matters worse, they're<lf>exponentially more powerful than before!
<string>It goes without saying that the biology of<lf>these Risen are a hazard to the ecosystem.<lf>Chichae has the quest, see to it ASAP.
<string>Heeeeey, <PL>!<lf>You eatin' right and gettin' enough rest!?
<string>Proper nutrition and sleep are essential.<lf>Without them, there's no way you can be<lf>efficient or effective in the field.
<string>I keep tellin' Fio, because it's important.<lf>But she always rolls her eyes at me. Y-You<lf>don't think I'm annoyin', do you?
<string>Just you wait, you gooey li'l suckers.<lf>I'm gonna open you up and find out<lf>exactly what makes you ick AND tick!
<string>Ahhhh! Nothin' more excitin' than<lf>dissection! The things you learn!<lf>Oh and the smell! THE SMELL!
<string>Man, this is gonna keep me up for days!<lf>But who needs sleep when you have<lf>research to do!? Well, you hunters do...
<string>You do the huntin' and I'll capture us<lf>some Qurio! We're gonna make a great<lf>team. Team...
<string>Yeah...team! Team Elgado! Woo!<lf>We're gonna be unstoppable!
<string>OK, let's go over the game plan one more<lf>time. You keep the monster busy while<lf>I bag some Qurio. Got it? Good!
<string>I'm countin' on you, <PL>!
<string>Malzeno and the Qurio...<lf>They're connected... But how...?<lf>Any ideas, <PL>?
<string>Haha, sorry, didn't mean to put you on<lf>the spot there! Don't worry about it.<lf>Just leave the thinkin' to us scientists!
<string>Every now and then, I kinda think out loud,<lf>that's all. Ignore me! But not, like "ignore"<lf>ignore me—Hey! Where are you goin'!?
<string><VO:SER>The biggest danger of the Qurio's poison<lf>is that you don't notice it until it's<lf>too late...
<string>But it's my job to figure out these things<lf>as soon as possible... I...really feel<lf>like I failed everyone...
<string>This is where the good Doctor's skills<lf>are required. Be a nice hunter and<lf>go look for Tadori, will you?
<string>Haha, I knew Tadori would come through<lf>for us! Always helps when you go way<lf>back with someone.
<string>Anyway, while Doc's handlin' that we can<lf>get on with our work until he has news for us.
<string>I still can't believe that this cycle is repeatin'<lf>itself. I guess that's nature, but still. To think<lf>the Qurio have been around since then...
<string>There's so much we still have to learn!<lf>Which is why my work is never done!
<string>Hmmm... So, Malzeno's grown and<lf>the Qurio have matured, therefore<lf>the poison's effect is more potent.
<string>My medical knowledge isn't all that great,<lf>so I find Tadori's analysis fascinatin'! But<lf>when it comes to extractin' poison...
<string>I'm your man! I'll get you bucketloads of<lf>the stuff. Just get me somethin' to extract<lf>it from and... *finger guns*
<string>Right back into the field, huh? I'd say sorry,<lf>but you live for this stuff, don't ya?
<string>But do me a favor, OK? When Fio's better,<lf>ya gotta bombard her with questions<lf>until she gets sick of it.
<string>"Did you eat?" "Did you get enough sleep?"<lf>You know, the kind of stuff someone<lf>who's recovering needs to hear.
<string>I know it's kind of a pain, but I can't seem<lf>to think straight when Fio's not around.<lf>Man, I hope she gets better soon...
<string>Alright, Team Elgado! Let's go over<lf>the game plan one more time, OK?<lf>You go out and take down Malzeno.
<string>Me? My Wyverian butt is stayin' right<lf>here in Elgado. Admiral Galleus gave<lf>specific instructions...
<string>And I intend to follow them to the...<lf>*yawn* letter! Got it? Good! I'll see<lf>you when I wake—when you get back!
<string>Can...I help you?
<string>Oh, right... THAT. Sorry...<lf>Yeah, you're right, the Admiral's got<lf>somethin' he's keepin' under wraps.
<string>We don't wanna risk spreadin' false info<lf>and causin' a panic.
<string>We're not tryin' to cut you two out<lf>or anythin'. We just need you to wait<lf>until we're more certain.
<string>The Qurio are becomin' more active but<lf>no new craters have formed—
<string>Oh, hey! Sorry about that. Lost in thought<lf>there. Or rather, deep in my research.
<string>Still a lot we don't understand, but that's<lf>where we're at. So...I guess just keep takin'<lf>on quests. Something's bound to happen!
<string>So far, the Qurio's behavior hasn't been<lf>cohesive, but now they're startin' to gather.<lf>Hmmm, what is goin' on?
<string>Maybe the Admiral's hypothesis has legs...
<string>Well, we won't know until we go and see<lf>for ourselves. Keep your guard up and be<lf>ready for anything.
<string>So the cause of this whole mess, even<lf>this strange weather, is the Archdemon<lf>of the Abyss...
<string>A monster straight out of a fairy tale...<lf>Sounds ridiculous but that's the situation<lf>we're in.
<string>With Malzeno out of the picture, it's up to<lf>us to stop this fiend. We have to if we<lf>wanna save the Kingdom and Kamura!
<string>But comin' back alive is also part of<lf>the mission. Don't mess that part up!<lf>Good luck to ya out there!
<string>So...everything's back to normal, huh?<lf>Hmph. I wish that were true.
<string>We're dealin' with somethin' totally<lf>new here. We need to be ready for<lf>anything.
<string>But hey, what's the worst that could happen?<lf>I mean, we got you here, right?
<string>Anyway, looks like a bunch of new quests<lf>came in. Better go have a look.
<string>The Qurio are actin' more like parasites.<lf>They're consumin' their host's life force.
<string>And the host is driven to a hyper-aggressive<lf>state until they've been sucked dry. It ain't<lf>pretty, but that's the way nature works.
<string>We all know you can hold your own out<lf>there, but still afflicted monsters will<lf>mess you up if you're not careful!
<string>So this Wind Serpent Ibushi was one<lf>of the monsters responsible for the<lf>Rampage, huh? That name's a mouthful.
<string>But seriously, if this monster is what<lf>everyone says it is, then it needs to<lf>be taken care of ASAP.
<string>I won't say it'll be easy, but we're all<lf>countin' on ya! Good luck out there,<lf><PL>!
<string>OK, Team Elgado, let's go over the game<lf>plan one more time. The Order will take<lf>care of the rampagin' monsters.
<string>And while they're jugglin' that mess,<lf>you take down Narwa! Got it? Good!
<string>Let's do this, Team Elgado! Operation<lf>"Stop the Rampage Before it Starts"<lf>is go!
<string>Look. I'm not sayin' this monster is gonna<lf>mess you up. I'm just sayin' it "could"<lf>mess you up...if you're not careful.
<string>And I'm not sayin' that you'll get messed<lf>up like the knights did. I'm just sayin' you<lf>could. All I'm sayin' is...
<string>That monster's whole thing is messin' things<lf>up. And that if you're not careful, you could<lf>be next. So be careful, OK?
<string>I understand that we shouldn't rely on you<lf>for everything. We have to be able to take<lf>care of ourselves too. But, come on...
<string>We gotta use the right tool for the job. And<lf>if we lose Fio, Elgado is done for. We can't<lf>risk it and we don't need that kind of stress.
<string>I mean, of course we're concerned about<lf>you, too. But look at the numbers and<lf>numbers don't lie!
<string>I was NOT expectin' a Magnamalo variant.<lf>The regular one was already scary enough!<lf>And now it's back with a bone to pick!?
<string>Where's this thing been hidin' anyway?<lf>I mean, there's been no sightings, reports,<lf>rumors, nothing. Man...
<string>So many unanswered questions! Either way,<lf>the people of Kamura have spoken and the<lf>task falls to you. See ya later!

<string>The reason I'm so hard on y'all about<lf>eatin' right and gettin' rest is because<lf>I'm so awful at it myself.
<string>Sometimes I get so focused on one thing,<lf>and it leads to another thing. And the<lf>next thing I know, it's been three days!
<string>And, MAN, do I pay for it. If you're tired<lf>and hungry you're never gonna get results.<lf>And that goes double for you hunters.
<string>One slip up out there and it's on the cart<lf>you go. There's no substitute for good<lf>food and sleep. None! You hear me!?
<string>This research lab is off limits to the<lf>general public. Too dangerous with all<lf>the chemicals...and "stuff" in there.
<string>But feel free to watch us work. We're<lf>always beaverin' away at somethin'.
<string>And if I'm lookin' tired and hungry, bang<lf>on the glass and tell me to eat some dango.<lf>I certainly deserve to take a break!
<string>The Doc and I are experts in different areas,<lf>but we both loooooove fieldwork. I think<lf>that's why we get along so well.
<string>When did we first meet...? Well, if<lf>I remember correctly, it was...out<lf>in the field!
<string>Generally, I never see anyone out there.<lf>I'm usually up a mountain or deep in the<lf>Jungle, right? So we made camp together.
<string>Tadori was just munchin' on raw herbs<lf>and mushrooms. I remember thinkin'<lf>"What is this man doin'!?"
<string>You know how I'm so particular about eatin'<lf>right, so naturally I thought that it was crazy<lf>that he was grazin' like an Aptonoth.
<string>Haha. I'm kiddin'. Well, kinda. Either way,<lf>we've been friends ever since. Funny how<lf>things work out, huh?
<string>It's good to see Fio back to her feisty self.<lf>Even if she is a royal pain to work with.<lf>We give each other a hard time, but...
<string>What would I do without her? Who would<lf>I argue with? YOU!? Haha! You barely say<lf>a thing!
<string>And Fio's such a good sport about it. She looks<lf>annoyed but she loves fightin' with me just as<lf>much as she loves fightin' monsters.
<string>And I do too. I love our little tiffs as much<lf>as I love my research work. Just...don't tell<lf>her that, K?
<string>Lend me a hand!
<string><NOFAC>Hey there! Sorry to spring this on you,<lf>but I need a favor! And it's urgent, so<lf>I'll cut to the chase. Check this out.
<string>Remember that four-second discrepancy<lf>I mentioned earlier? I figured it out! Fio<lf>didn't eat before the quest!
<string>Which is fine, I guess, but it got me thinkin'.<lf>Do monsters suffer a degradation in<lf>performance from lack of nourishment?
<string>So to support my theory, I want you to<lf>go hunt me an Anjanath and a Pukei—<lf>Hm? Why? WHY? *sigh*
<string>Because this is the time of year when both<lf>monsters have the most ferocious appetites!<lf>They're perfect specimens! Duh!
<string>Hunt them both and then report your findings.<lf>Got it? Good. Well? What are ya waitin' for?<lf>Time is zenny, ya know! Get goin'!
<string>Lend me a hand!
<string><NOFAC>Impeccable timing, as always!<lf>JUST the person I wanted to see!
<string>So check this out. I wanted to study the<lf>physical effects of status ailments but no<lf>one was willin' to be a test sub— *ahem*
<string>I mean, it's hard, with everything goin' on,<lf>to find volunteers. So that's where you<lf>come in! Don't look so scared. It's easy!
<string>And, OBVIOUSLY, there's somethin' in it<lf>for you. This could even change the face<lf>of huntin' forever!
<string>See!? Caught your interest, huh? All ya<lf>gotta do is subject your body to poison,<lf>ice, fire, the Frenzy virus—
<string>Wait! Where are you goin'? I haven't<lf>finished explainin' yet! *sigh* FINE,<lf>just go do my quest then...
<string>Big thanks!
<string><NOFAC>Thanks for taking care of all my Research<lf>Requests! Now I'm up to my elbows in<lf>data! I couldn't have done without ya!
<string>I've prepared a special reward for you.<lf>It's some Investigation Coins! Enjoy!
