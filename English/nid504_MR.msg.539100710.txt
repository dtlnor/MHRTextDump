<string>We must make haste...
<string><VO:SER>Greetings, <PL>.<lf>There is something I wish to discuss with you.
<string>An afflicted monster has attacked a nearby<lf>village, injuring some of its residents. And now<lf>those poor souls have fallen ill with affliction...
<string>I thought my medicine for treating Fiorayne<lf>would suffice, but the virus has evolved,<lf>rendering my medicine ineffective...
<string>However, with the recent discovery of<lf>a <COLS RED>Flaming Espinas</COL>, we may have a chance!<lf>If these beasts are as toxic as they say...
<string>We may be able to increase the medicine's<lf>potency using its toxin. Risky, but we've no<lf>other choice...
<string>Chichae has the request to hunt the beast.<lf>Time is of the essence if we are to save<lf>the villagers. I leave the rest to you.
<string>Just a bit more...
<string>You have my thanks for hunting that Flaming<lf>Espinas. We've made excellent progress with<lf>the medicine. However...
<string><VO:SER>I'm afraid it's still missing one vital<lf>ingredient. Fluid from a <COLS RED>Violet Mizutsune</COL>.<lf>Forgive me, but might you hunt one for me?
<string>...And judging by the look on your face you<lf>must be wondering how does one use poison<lf>and soapy monster juice to make medicine?
<string>I can assure you that it does indeed work—<lf>No, that's not it? Oh, you want to know about<lf>the monster no one's ever heard of before!
<string>Ha! Do not concern yourself with such things,<lf>dear Hunter! Now if you would, Chichae has<lf>the details! Get me that fluid!
<string>I expected nothing less!
<string>Astounding work! Thanks to your efforts,<lf>I was able to complete the medicine and<lf>treat the villagers.
<string>I got my fair share of praise, but I<lf>just did what any doctor would.
<string>And I couldn't have done it without you!<lf>I put in a commendation to the Guild for<lf>you, as well!
<string>Now that those villagers are recovering, every-<lf>one else can focus on rebuilding. Progress<lf>is being made, slowly, but surely.
<string>I must say, when seeing everyone working<lf>together to rebuild... I...I can't help but<lf>recall the home I lost...
<string>I think of Kagero, and her highness...<lf>*ahem* At any rate, your assistance<lf>has been invaluable.
<string>There's still much to be done, but as long<lf>as we have you with us, we may continue<lf>to help those in need!
<string>Might I ask a favor?
<string>I know you're busy, but I was wondering<lf>if you could assist me in procuring some<lf>materials I need.
<string>Could I trouble you to bring me a Diablos<lf>horn? Monster horn is a fine ingredient<lf>for medicines and elixirs.
<string>I normally gather my own ingredients,<lf>but procuring the horn of a beast such<lf>a Diablos is no easy feat.
<string>And as an added incentive, if you'll<lf>help me, I shall share a way to<lf>strengthen a certain bow.
<string>It appears the medicine can<lf>now be made.
<string>Oh, marvelous. That is a fine horn indeed!<lf>Thank you very much. This is exactly what<lf>I needed!
<string>And you brought it to me with such haste.<lf>What a remarkable hunter you are.
<string>Now, I've already told the Smithy the<lf>method in which to strengthen the bow.<lf>Go there if you wish to inquire further.

<string><VO:SER>So Amatsu has reared its hideous visage<lf>once more. And this time it's attacking<lf>Kagero's second home, Kamura Village.
<string>I cannot even imagine how he must feel<lf>right now... Especially after witnessing<lf>that creature's cruelty first hand.
<string>I, as well, felt immense anger when I heard<lf>its cursed name. It was enough to make<lf>me quiver with rage!
<string>I am worried Kagero might do something<lf>rash... I know he feels responsible.
<string>I'm confident that Elder Fugen will try to<lf>talk some sense into him, so I hope I'm<lf>just being a worrywart, but still...
<string>I've been a doctor for some time.
<string>As you know, when the plague was ravaging<lf>the Kingdom fifty years ago, I concocted<lf>a medicine to cure the afflicted.
<string>If the Qurio were to blame for that plague,<lf>then my medicine should work for Lady Fiorayne.
<string>Sadly none of it is left, but worry not,<lf>more shall be prepared as quickly as<lf>Wyverianly possible!
<string>Thank you for agreeing to hunt<lf>that Espinas. I can only apologize<lf>for putting you in this position.
<string>Kagero has written of your exploits<lf>numerous times, so I know you're<lf>more than up to the task.
<string>I wish I could make the medicine with what<lf>I have on hand, but sadly I cannot. Again,<lf>I apologize for causing you such trouble.
<string>I can't thank you enough for hunting<lf>that Espinas.
<string>Now I'll do my part and prepare Lady<lf>Fiorayne's medicine.
<string>Even as a newcomer to Elgado, one can see<lf>how her condition affects the atmosphere<lf>here. But fear not, she'll soon be well.
<string>I'm so pleased that Lady Fiorayne is<lf>back on her feet!
<string>As expected, the atmosphere in Elgado<lf>has lightened.
<string>However, she's departing to battle Malzeno.<lf>Troubling indeed...
<string>I hear the monster has some special<lf>significance for the people of Elgado.<lf>Well, I can only pray for your safety.
<string>What can I say? How incredible that you<lf>defeated Malzeno!
<string>But I fear the worst is still to come...<lf>And Admiral Galleus shares my sentiment.
<string>For now, let us hope that our fears<lf>are groundless...
<string><VO:SER>...Absorbing life!? Clearly, a completely<lf>different situation to that of the plague<lf>all those years ago...
<string>If there's anything I can do...<lf>Anything at all, just let me know.
<string>The way the sky looks, I wouldn't be<lf>surprised if new trouble is on the way.<lf>Look after yourself.
<string>I first came to the Kingdom after learning<lf>of the plague running rampant.
<string>So I wasn't present for Malzeno's abhorrent<lf>attack or any of the rumbling growls from<lf>underground.
<string>However when Galleus's home was struck,<lf>he heard those eerie sounds bellowing from<lf>below. It must have been terrifying...
<string>Despite all this, I'm quite confident we shall<lf>overcome this peril. We have you, conqueror<lf>of Malzeno, and the Royal Order to count on.
<string>What superb work! I never doubted you, but...<lf>I'm relieved to see you back safe anyway!
<string>And with the crisis over, I was thinking of<lf>departing soon. However, Oboro expressed<lf>that he'd like to talk to me more...
<string>Perhaps I shall remain in Elgado a tad longer.<lf>It is such a wonderful place.
<string>If you find time in your busy schedule,<lf>I'd be delighted to sit down and hear<lf>all about your adventures.
<string>It was when I was studying herbs around<lf>Elgado that Oboro took it upon himself<lf>to become my student.
<string>I was gathering flora when he suddenly<lf>appeared out of nowhere and started<lf>watching my every move.
<string>Apparently he found the idea of studying<lf>plants in the field to classify them and<lf>identify their properties rather novel.
<string>Why it moved him so, I do not know,<lf>but he asked to study under me then<lf>and there.
<string>I had no reason to turn him down, really.<lf>And I thought, if my knowledge could be<lf>of use, why not?
<string>Though the truth is, I'm always working<lf>in the field, so I wonder how effective<lf>of a teacher I can really be...
<string>Both Kagero and I were hunters back<lf>in our home village.
<string>But being fond of academic study, I took<lf>up medicine. Meanwhile Kagero, with his<lf>talent for weapons, rose to greatness.
<string>Then one day, when I was gathering<lf>herbs out in the field, our village suffered<lf>a horrendous attack by monsters.
<string>When I returned, there was nothing left.<lf>Everything a smoldering ruin...<lf>Everyone gone...
<string>Since then, I've thrown myself into my<lf>studies of medicine even more. At least<lf>there are some I can save that way.
<string>And that meant I've not really laid my<lf>hat anywhere since, as it were. Very<lf>different to Kagero in so many ways.
<string>During my stay here in Elgado, it would<lf>be a waste not to visit Kamura.
<string>Perhaps...you would accompany me<lf>when I go?
<string>It's been so long, I'm...a little nervous<lf>to see Kagero again...
<string>Dear me, I heard that Kagero attempted<lf>to face Amatsu on his own. So impulsive...<lf>And terrifying! What was he thinking!?
<string>I can relate to the anguish he felt, but<lf>to have troubled the princess like that<lf>is unforgivable.
<string>I shall go and speak with him. It has been<lf>too long. There's a lot to discuss, and<lf>I would like to see the princess again, too.
<string><VO:SER>Why is this monster showing up now of all<lf>times? I suppose it's out of the frying pan,<lf>into the fire, as they say.
<string>The Fierce... You are the one who brings<lf>light and hope to all our hearts. May you<lf>return swiftly and safely. Gogspeed.
<string>There's our hero! We all cannot thank you<lf>enough. You have vanquished the Kingdom's<lf>biggest threat and restored peace to the land.
<string>I truly believe the worst has passed for<lf>both Kamura and the Kingdom. Perhaps<lf>it is time for me to depart Elgado...
<string>Like you, I wish to continue to help others.<lf>But if I'm to do that, I need to further my<lf>medicinal studies. Wish me luck!
