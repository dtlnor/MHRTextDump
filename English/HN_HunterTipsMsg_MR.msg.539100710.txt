<string>A hunter raised in Kamura and considered<lf>a family member by all of its citizens.<lf>Known as "the Fierce," you're a peerless<lf>warrior who excels in weapon mastery.<lf>Now, you are the hero who has repeatedly<lf>repelled the Rampage that plagued the<lf>village for years.

<string>An admiral commanding the Elgado Outpost<lf>and the official leader of the Knights of the<lf>Royal Order. Though taciturn, his leadership<lf>is strong and undeniable, and he has the trust<lf>not only of the knights, but of all in the Kingdom.<lf>He has been tasked with defeating the Kingdom's<lf>nemesis, the elder dragon, Malzeno along with<lf>preventing Kingdom monsters from invading<lf>the surrounding territories.

His brilliant mind<lf>has solved many tricky problems in the<lf>past, but his insatiable curiosity can make<lf>him blinkered and prone to unexpected<lf>outbursts, so he's considered an eccentric<lf>as well as a genius. He can inadvertently<lf>cause trouble for those around him,<lf>though he always means well.
