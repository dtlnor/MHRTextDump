<string>Savior of Kamura, huh?<lf>Should be interesting...
<string><NPC:605><CAM:0><LOOK:605,CAM><NOFAC>And here you are at last! Kamura Village's<lf>ultimate hunter.
<string>Well, this is a pleasant surprise. I was<lf>expecting you to be some kind of<lf>muscle-bound goon, yeah?
<string>But you've got the eyes of a level-headed<lf>hunter. No wonder you're so beloved<lf>back home.
<string>Gotta say, I'm a little jealous, yeah?<lf>Maybe if I'd cut my teeth in Kamura,<lf>I could have been a big shot hero too...
<string>Hmph. Pay me no mind, yeah?<lf>I'm just a grumpy ol' warhorse.<lf>Anyway...
<string>Allow me to properly introduce myself.<lf>I'm Arlow. Chief instructor of this fine<lf>outpost. Welcome.
<string>While I am the chief instructor here, a lot of<lf>our combat is derived from Kamura's expertise.<lf>Kamura must have a great instructor.
<string><CAM:1><LOOK:809,CAM>...Oi! Wouldn't you agree,<lf>Master Utsushi?
<string><NPC:809><SCAM:2><VO:SP2>Aw, shurikens, you knew I was up here!<lf>Wouldn't expect anything less from<lf>a knight of the Royal Order!
<string>Be down in a sec! And, uh, no Cohoots, OK?
<string><NOFAC><NPC:809><CAM:3><LOOK:809,605,605,809>Impressive awareness, Master Arlow! You<lf>didn't even look and you knew I was there.<lf>You're as sharp as shurikens!
<string><NPC:605>Gimme a break. Don't act like you didn't<lf>want to be spotted. And drop the "Master"<lf>nonsense, yeah?
<string><NPC:809>Haha! You got it! Well, let's get<lf>down to business!
<string><CAM:7,8>But first... Yo, Ace, did you check out that<lf>gnarly crater!? That thing's huge! Almost<lf>like something fell out of the sky!
<string><NPC:605>Massive, innit? You know, there's a lot<lf>of people in the Kingdom that say the<lf>same thing.
<string>Some even say, "It's like the sun fell<lf>out of the sky."
<string><SCAM:3>If you really want someone to talk your ear<lf>off about it, go chat up Pasapato, yeah?
<string><NPC:809>Gnarly! I'll go check him out later!
<string><LOOK:809,CAM>Alright, Ace! I forgot something back in Kamura—<lf>No, I brought everything with me! I mean,<lf>I forgot to— You know what? Let's start over...
<string><LOOK:605,CAM>*ahem* I've finally completed a new hunting<lf>technique I've been workin' on. I just, uh,<lf>forgot to tell you about it before you left!
<string><LOOK:809,605>That's why I gotta ask you to come back<lf>to Kamura. You can come too if you like,<lf>Arlow!
<string><NPC:605><LOOK:605,809>This should be interesting, yeah?<lf>Count me in.
<string><NPC:809><LOOK:809,CAM>OK, I'll head back and wait for you there.<lf>As soon as you're ready, let Arlow know<lf>and head on over.
<string><LOOK:605,CAM>...Hey, what's with the face?
<string>C'mon. You know the Arena's the safest<lf>place to learn new stuff. And, besides,<lf>there's no arena in Elgado...
<string><NPC:605>Yep... No arena here. They skimped out on<lf>the luxuries when building this place. Only<lf>thing fancy here is the name.
<string>We do got a nice pool out back, yeah?
<string><NPC:809>Haha! Right? Alright, Ace. See you back<lf>in Kamura!
<string><NPC:605>Back on the boat, yeah?
<string><NOFAC><NPC:809><CAM:3><LOOK:809,605,605,809>Impressive awareness, Master Arlow! You<lf>didn't even look and you knew I was there.<lf>You're as sharp as shurikens!
<string><NPC:605>Gimme a break. Don't act like you didn't<lf>want to be spotted. And drop the "Master"<lf>nonsense, yeah?

<string><NPC:809>Gnarly! I'll go check him out later!
<string><LOOK:809,CAM>Alright, Ace. The reason I came all the way<lf>from Kamura was to teach you some gnarly<lf>new hunting techniques! Are ya ready!?
<string><LOOK:605,CAM>First up, <COLS RED>Switch Skills</COL>! It's an awesome<lf>way to put your own personal spin on<lf>your basic move set!
<string>You can change out <COLS RED>Switch Skills from<lf>your Item Box</COL>. And during quests,<lf>the tent's Item Box works, too!
<string>Switch Skills open up a wide world of<lf>thrashing possibilities. Try them all<lf>out until you find the ones that click!
<string>As for the second technique... Well...
<string><LOOK:809,605>You'll have to come to Kamura's Arena<lf>to find out. You can tag along too,<lf>if you like, Arlow!
<string><NPC:605><LOOK:605,809>This should be interesting, yeah?<lf>Count me in.
<string><NPC:809><LOOK:809,CAM>OK, I'll head back and wait for you there.<lf>As soon as you're ready, let Arlow know<lf>and head on over.
<string><LOOK:605,CAM>...Hey, what's with the face?
<string>C'mon. You know the Arena's the safest<lf>place to learn new stuff. And, besides,<lf>there's no arena in Elgado...
<string><NPC:605>Yep... No arena here. They skimped out on<lf>the luxuries when building this place. Only<lf>thing fancy here is the name.
<string>We do got a nice pool out back, yeah?
<string><NPC:809>Haha! Right? Alright, Ace. See you back<lf>in Kamura!
<string><NPC:605>Back on the boat, yeah?
<string>Kamura Village.<lf>This should be good!
<string><NPC:605><NOFAC>Let's get going, yeah? Utsushi's waiting<lf>for us.
<string><NPC:605><NOFAC><CAM:0><LOOK:605,CAM>Welcome back. You must be beat, but<lf>that training session was worth it, yeah?
<string>Let's just hope you don't have to make<lf>any more sudden trips back.
<string>I'll be workin' closely with Utsushi so you<lf>can take on Arena quests from me, too.<lf>Give a shout if you want a challenge.
<string>Guess since Utsushi's not around, it'll be<lf>up to me to bring the enthusiasm, yeah?<lf>Hmph... Wouldn't count on it.
<string>Oh, one more thing. It's about the lass<lf>in charge of quests here in Elgado.
<string><CAM:4,5>That's her over there. <COLS RED>Princess Chichae</COL>.
<string>Findin' that "princess" bit hard to<lf>swallow, yeah? Trust me, the li'l<lf>miss is our princess.
<string><SCAM:0>Oi! Don't gimme that look! I'm tellin'<lf>the truth! That girl there is the heiress<lf>to the throne.
<string>She didn't want to be locked up in the castle<lf>while everyone was out riskin' their lives. So<lf>she became a quest receptionist.
<string>She'll tell you everythin' you need to<lf>know about your assignments. Should<lf>have training quests for you, too.
<string>...Just watch how you talk to her, yeah?
<string>Blasted monster...
<string><NOFAC><VO:SER>So we've got a bit of a monster problem—<lf>several problems, actually. Do us a favor<lf>and help us solve 'em, yeah?
<string>First up is a <COLS RED>Seething Bazelgeuse</COL>. Blasted<lf>monster is out there blowing things to bits.<lf>It's a mess, yeah?
<string>We sent some knights from the Order to<lf>check it out, but no word back from them.<lf>Hopefully they haven't been blown to bits, too...
<string>Goes without saying that the situation's<lf>gotta be dealt with, yeah? Think you're<lf>up to it? Good. Chichae's got the details.
<string>Quite the lineup we have here...
<string><NOFAC>So not even that blasted monster could<lf>slow you down, yeah? That's good.<lf>REAL good!
<string>And since you took care of it before things<lf>got out of control, everyone made it back<lf>in one piece. Good work.
<string><VO:SER>I'd take you out to celebrate, but we're<lf>not done yet. We've got a "couple" of<lf>Raths bein' a royal pain.
<string><NOFAC>More specifically, a <COLS RED>Silver Rathalos</COL>,<lf>and a <COL RED>Gold Rathian</COL>...
<string>Fortunately for us, the lovebirds haven't<lf>met up for their night on the town. Still, it's<lf>only a matter of time before they do, yeah?
<string>We've confirmed their location. The <COLS RED>Tower</COL>.<lf>It's an old structure, built by the ancients.<lf>Perfect place for a monster rendezvous...
<string>Not sure what kind of date night those Raths<lf>got planned, but I'm not really interested in<lf>findin' out, yeah? You know what to do.
<string>Both urgent quests should have reached<lf>Chichae by now. The rest is up to you.
<string>A dangerous foe...
<string><NOFAC>Good job takin' care of those Raths,<lf>yeah? Everyone was pleased with how<lf>you handled it. Well, almost everyone...
<string>Bahari was a little upset that he didn't<lf>get a chance to observe 'em out in the<lf>wild. Heh.
<string>I mean, I know his research is important,<lf>yeah? But barbequed Bahari doesn't sound<lf>very appetizing, does it?
<string><VO:SER>Either way, we're gettin' closer to solvin'<lf>our "li'l" monster problems. Just got one<lf>left to deal with...
<string><NOFAC>And you're gonna have a lot of "fun"<lf>with this one, too! Ever dealt with<lf>a <COLS RED>Lucent Nargacuga</COL> before?
<string>Well, you're in for a treat. Incredible power<lf>and speed—puts the normal variety to<lf>shame. And it's got this disappearin' act...
<string>You'll see...or not. Either way, huntin' it is<lf>gonna require mastery over your senses.<lf>It's gonna test you at every turn.
<string>But if there's anyone that can defeat this<lf>beast, it's you. Just remember everything<lf>that master of yours taught ya, yeah?
<string>Well then, you know what to do. But do<lf>us a favor, yeah? Come back in one piece.<lf>We still need you around here.
<string>Back in one piece, yeah?
<string><NOFAC>Good work out there. I had little doubt you'd<lf>get it done, but you never know. Especially<lf>considering what you were dealing with...
<string>Your master would be proud. And now that<lf>you've come back with all your bones in<lf>the right spots, we can celebrate, yeah?
<string>But as much as I'd love to think that<lf>parade of awful monsters was the last<lf>of it, the world isn't so kind.
<string>Galleus and Fiorayne have their hands<lf>full with those afflicted monsters. Elgado<lf>is gonna need all the backup it can get.
<string>Still, there wouldn't be an Elgado to back<lf>up without your help. Much appreciated,<lf>yeah?
<string>Up for a little challenge, yeah?
<string><NOFAC>As an instructor, you know I gotta throw<lf>a little test at you every now and then.
<string>I've arranged some Master Rank arena<lf>quests just for you. Aren't I sweet? Have<lf>a look when the mood strikes ya.
<string>Just like the others up till now, these<lf>quests are unlocked as your skills<lf>progress.
<string>Just how far can yours take you?
<string>Come by anytime when ya feel like<lf>answering that question, yeah?
<string>That's what I'm talking about!
<string><NOFAC>Well look at that, <PL>!<lf>You've completed every single arena quest!
<string>Gotta say, you've exceeded my expectations,<lf>yeah? Never thought you'd finish 'em all <lf>so fast!
<string>So, to mark your triumph over the arena,<lf>I've prepared you a little something, this<lf><COLS RED>Soaring Feather</COL>.
<string>Don't get all mushy on me now. I'm not<lf>the sentimental type like Utsushi, yeah?<lf>But I'm still pretty proud of you!
<string>And remember: The path a hunter walks<lf>never truly ends. Keep pushing your limits!
<string>Good job, yeah?
<string>Well look at that, <PL>!<lf>You've completed every single arena quest!
<string>Gotta say, you've exceeded my expectations,<lf>yeah? Never thought you'd finish 'em all <lf>so fast!
<string>So, to mark your triumph over the arena,<lf>I've prepared you a little something, this<lf><COLS RED>Soaring Feather</COL>.
<string>...Oh. Looks like your equipment box<lf>is full. You'll need to make some room<lf>before I can give this to you, yeah?
<string>Rather impressive, yeah?
<string><NOFAC>Well, <PL>. Looks like you've<lf>aced all the arena quests!
<string>As an instructor, I've seen a lot of good<lf>hunters come and go. But none quite<lf>like you. Your master must be proud.
<string>But the Kingdom won't be outdone, yeah?<lf>I'm gonna use you as an example to<lf>everyone I train! They're in for a surprise!
<string>Anyway, to mark your besting of the<lf>arena, I want you to have this<lf><COLS RED>Blessed Feather</COL>.
<string>Can't wait to see what amazing feats<lf>you pull off next. I mean, there's still<lf>more in the Fierce yet, yeah!?
<string>Rather impressive, yeah?
<string>Well, <PL>. Looks like you've<lf>aced all the arena quests!
<string>As an instructor, I've seen a lot of good<lf>hunters come and go. But none quite<lf>like you. Your master must be proud.
<string>But the Kingdom won't be outdone, yeah?<lf>I'm gonna use you as an example to<lf>everyone I train! They're in for a surprise!
<string>Anyway, to mark your besting of the<lf>arena, I want you to have this<lf><COLS RED>Blessed Feather</COL>.
<string>...Oh. Looks like your equipment box<lf>is full. You'll need to make some room<lf>before I can give this to you, yeah?
<string>Wanna go huntin', yeah?
<string><NOFAC>Alright. Been expecting ya.<lf>Got something for ya if you're<lf>interested.
<string>Do us a favor, yeah, and I'll let you have it.
<string>Not a big deal. Just take an ol' sod out huntin'.
<string>Already posted the quest details.<lf>When you fancy the urge, have<lf>a look at it, will ya?
<string>Appreciated.
<string><NOFAC>Alright. Thanks for lookin' out.
<string>I may not be front line anymore, but we<lf>can't have a busted ol' has-been runnin'<lf>the arena can we?
<string>So, yeah, if we could do this from time<lf>to time, that'd be great. When ya fancy<lf>the urge, let me know.
<string>As for you reward, enjoy.
<string>Wanna go huntin', yeah?
<string><NOFAC>Alright, then.<lf>Got a hold of another prized item. Interested?
<string>Same deal as last time. We go huntin'<lf>together, I give you a reward.
<string>Win, win, innit?
<string>Already posted the quest details.<lf>When you fancy the urge, have<lf>a look at it, will ya?
<string>Appreciated.
<string><NOFAC>Thanks for lookin' out.<lf>I got a real good look at what makes<lf>that monster tick.
<string>Anyway, I know there's not much to learn<lf>from an ol' sod like me, but I can still be<lf>of use to you.
<string>There is someone, however, that can benefit<lf>from my expertise. Sir Jae is a real talent.<lf>Just needs some proper guidance.
<string>Well, enough 'bout that. Here's your reward<lf>for lookin' out. Enjoy.
<string>Wanna go huntin', yeah?
<string><NOFAC>Alright. Been expecting ya.<lf>Got another favor for ya.
<string>Same deal as last time. We go huntin'<lf>together, I give you a reward.
<string>Only this time the reward is...a bit different.<lf>You'll see.
<string>Already posted the quest details.<lf>When you fancy the urge, have<lf>a look at it, will ya?
<string>Appreciated.
<string><NOFAC>Alright. Thanks for lookin' out.<lf>Ready for your "mystery" reward, yeah?
<string>Here's the deal. Whenever you take<lf>a quest and you fancy a little company,<lf>you can call me up.
<string>How 'bout it, yeah? Surprised? ...NO!?<lf>Ah, that's right. I forgot about that<lf>"enthusiastic" instructor of yours.
<string>We don't really do that sorta thing here.<lf>Teachers holding their students hands<lf>out in the field. Guess you're used to it.
<string>Don't expect any hand-holding from me.<lf>I'm not the type, yeah? Consider my<lf>presence an honor.
<string>Wanna go huntin', yeah?
<string><NOFAC>Alright, alright. Nice timin'!
<string>Got a little quest request. Can't do this<lf>one solo, so if you can do us a favor,<lf>yeah?
<string>Don't worry, there's a reward.
<string>Already posted the quest details.<lf>When you fancy the urge, have<lf>a look at it, will ya?
<string>Appreciated.
<string><NOFAC>Thanks for lookin' out.<lf>How 'bout it? I still got it, yeah?
<string>I know I'm gettin' up there, but an instructor's<lf>gotta keep up appearances.
<string>And you know what? I think watchin'<lf>you out there has been good for me.<lf>Rekindled that burning desire to hunt.
<string>I guess it's hard for someone whose flame<lf>still burns bright inside them to understand.<lf>But, yeah, proper burning now, innit?
<string>Let's do it again sometime when<lf>ya fancy the urge.
<string>Wanna go huntin', yeah?
<string><NOFAC>Alright.<lf>Doing anythin' much just now?
<string>I was thinkin', yeah. Maybe we could invite<lf>the Admiral out on a hunt with us.
<string>I mean, the guy just stands there the whole<lf>time doin' nothin'. Man's gonna turn to stone<lf>if he's not careful.
<string>So anyway, I'll go talk to him about it<lf>while you ready up the quest, yeah?
<string>Appreciated.
<string><NOFAC>That was somethin', yeah? Proper<lf>good times!
<string>I'm glad Galleus can count of you when<lf>he wants to cut loose.
<string>He's is one of those by-the-book-types,<lf>so he'd never call up the Order just for<lf>a personal favor, yeah?
<string>But since you're not a member, he can<lf>call on you without that burden. But<lf>he's not going to go wasting your time.
<string>He'll make sure you're properly rewarded,<lf>so I hope you'll oblige him the next time<lf>he asks, yeah?
<string>Got a little favor, yeah?
<string><NOFAC>Sorry, I know you're busy, but I need<lf>your help with something, yeah?<lf>Gunlance research.
<string>I'm working with Minayle right now on<lf>upgrading our gunlances. We're getting<lf>materials together to experiment with.
<string>I've finally whittled down what I need to<lf>Basarios materials. Nothing is as tough<lf>or as heat resistant.
<string>That's where you come in, yeah? I need you<lf>to go out there and get me some Basarios<lf>materials. You'll be compensated, of course.
<string>Just what I needed!
<string><NOFAC>Now that everything's in order, we can<lf>get to upgrading those gunlances.<lf>Appreciate it!
<string>And for your trouble, I'll let you in on<lf>what we've been working on. Go chat<lf>with Minayle for the details.
<string>I tell ya, it's good to have someone as<lf>reliable as you around. Hope I can keep<lf>counting on ya, yeah?
<string>Oi! Got a sec?
<string><NOFAC>So, I got a letter from Utsushi saying<lf>he wants to make a new mask, based<lf>on Magnamalo.
<string>I'm not sure what all this mask business<lf>is about but I am interested to see what<lf>he comes up with, yeah?
<string>Anyway, as much as I'd like to go out there<lf>myself, this old geezer has to stay in Elgado.<lf>Can you go out and capture a Magnamalo?
<string>Not exactly picking up bread and milk,<lf>but I'm sure you can handle it. I'll have<lf>something for you when you get back.
<string>Much appreciated.
<string><NOFAC>Utsushi got in touch again. Said that<lf>Magnamalo was just what he needed.
<string>I was hoping to check out his work, but<lf>who knows when he'll finish. Guess you<lf>can't rush inspiration, yeah?
<string>Anyway, I talked to Minayle over at the<lf>Smithy about your reward. She should<lf>have something for ya. Go see if you like it.
<string>Oi! Got something I need to discuss<lf>with you, yeah?
<string><NOFAC>The Guild has served up a real tasty quest.<lf>One with some spice, yeah?
<string>I guess the Guild's throwing everything<lf>at capturing a particular Bazelgeuse that's<lf>been causing a lot of headaches...
<string>Obviously the Kingdom's been discussing<lf>it, too, and they've decided to award some<lf>special armor to anyone who captures it.
<string>Back in the day, I'd have been all over<lf>this, but this old geezer's gotta stay put.<lf>So do us a favor and go capture it, yeah?
<string>Impressive, yeah?
<string><NOFAC>Good stuff, yeah? I knew you could do it.<lf>I've already informed the Guild.
<string>You know, when I see you out there taking<lf>care of business it reminds that I wasn't<lf>always a gray ol' geezer.
<string>Anyway, don't mind me. Just reminiscing.<lf>Minayle has the details about that special<lf>armor. Have a look when you fancy to.
<string>I heard about Amatsu. Kamura's a magnet<lf>for calamities, yeah?
<string>Well, I'm sure they got nothin' to worry<lf>about if you're takin' care of things.<lf>You look confident enough, yeah?
<string>Leave Elgado to us. You go protect<lf>your home. But do us a favor, yeah?<lf>Come back in one piece!
<string>I see you've met our princess. Good work<lf>not Bullfangoing up your introduction, yeah?
<string>Right. So like the young miss says, taking out<lf>Malzeno is our primary objective.
<string>I've heard lots of impressive things about<lf>you. Do an ol' geezer a favor and show us<lf>what you can do, yeah?
<string>It's not often you hear Galleus blow his<lf>top, yeah? Didn't know the ol' geezer<lf>still had it in him.
<string>The ol' man ain't much for words.<lf>But believe me, his skills come<lf>across loud and clear, yeah?
<string>He's more than capable of this command.<lf>I've seen what he can do with my own<lf>eyes. But that's a tale for another day.
<string>Huh? Miss me already? Go talk to <COLS RED>Chichae<lf>the Quest Damsel</COL>, to see how quests work.
<string>...And don't forget what I said. She's our<lf>beloved princess and heiress to the throne.<lf>Watch how you talk to her, yeah?
<string>Made quick work of that Blood Orange<lf>Bishaten, yeah? Got all of Elgado<lf>talking about you.
<string>What, are you embarrassed?<lf>Listen, don't worry about what other<lf>people say. Whether it's good or bad.
<string>With someone as bold as you, there are<lf>bound to be rumors. And people running<lf>their mouth.
<string>Finally going up against the Three Lords,<lf>yeah? Good. Like your Master says, give<lf>'em a good thrashin'!
<string>And lose the modesty, yeah? Galleus is<lf>the Admiral. He knows what he's doing.<lf>He's picked the right hunter for this.
<string>Well, that's enough talk from me, yeah?<lf>Go get to work.
<string>Bahari's back, yeah? Heh, that man never<lf>changes.
<string>Personally, I don't really care what he does<lf>or how he does it. Because what he does<lf>gets results.
<string>And whether you're hunting or doing<lf>research, it's results that count, yeah?<lf>So I, for one, rate Bahari highly.
<string>That's one stomach-turning specimen,<lf>yeah? And these little beasties are the<lf>clue to explain this situation?
<string>I mean granted, anything that ugly's<lf>bound to be trouble. Must've been<lf>"fun" capturing them alive, yeah?
<string>Wait—Bahari caught those things barehanded?<lf>That man might be crazier than we think.
<string>So Malzeno finally showed up, yeah?
<string>I've been after that monster for years...
<string>I bet ol' Galleus is beside himself—<lf>Sorry, forget I said that. I was thinking<lf>out loud.
<string><VO:SER>Gotta say, when I heard about<lf>Fiorayne I was shocked, yeah?<lf>She's almost like a daughter to me...
<string>And as a leader, I've let you down. And no<lf>amount of apologies can make up for that.
<string>*sigh* Guess I shouldn't dwell on the "ifs,"<lf>but still...
<string>So, this medicine Fiorayne needs...<lf>It can be made, yeah? That's a relief.
<string>The whole of Elgado's leaning heavily<lf>on you right now. And me too, yeah?<lf>We're counting on you!
<string>So you gathered all the ingredients<lf>for the medicine Fiorayne needs.<lf>Great work, yeah?
<string>Without Fiorayne, Elgado's not the same, yeah?<lf>Everything we're trying to achieve depends on<lf>her skill and leadership. And yours too.
<string>We all appreciate what you've done, and<lf>I want to thank you, too. For saving MY<lf>favorite pupil.
<string>Finally pinned down Malzeno's location,<lf>yeah? And the Citadel of all places.<lf>A fitting place for a day of reckoning...
<string>Some might say it's bad for us that<lf>Malzeno and its little beastie friends<lf>are working together, but I disagree...
<string>It means the whole lot will go down in<lf>one fell swoop. And I've no doubt you<lf>can deliver the blow. Get to work, yeah?
<string>You did it, yeah? Our old nemesis, Malzeno.<lf>Finally gone...
<string>Your lot making us geezers look bad, but<lf>I'm not too upset. Get to sit back, relax.<lf>Maybe even enjoy my retirement, yeah?
<string>Unfortunately for you, there's no rest for<lf>"<PL>, the Fierce!"
<string>Sky's getting dark, yeah? Looks like<lf>more than just clouds gathering...<lf>There's menace in the air.
<string>Don't know what's coming, but forewarned<lf>is forearmed. Those are an ol' geezer's<lf>words you'd do well to heed.
<string>So fairy-tale monsters are real... I've seen<lf>some crazy things in my time, but didn't<lf>see that one coming...
<string>Don't need to tell you, but this fight...<lf>Mince this one up and the whole<lf>Kingdom is Bullfangoed.
<string>Make us proud out there. And do us<lf>a favor, yeah? Come back alive.
<string>What can an ol' geezer say? You did good,<lf>yeah? And look at that. All rainbows and<lf>Cutterflies out.
<string>The threat is over, but research is gonna<lf>continue. You sticking around, yeah?<lf>Ha! You're something else!
<string>Well, as long as you're in Elgado, we'll<lf>put you to good use! Like I said, no<lf>rest for "<PL>, the Fierce!"
<string>Since I've withdrawn from frontline duties,<lf>you'll find me teaching Elgado's newly<lf>enlisted.
<string>I'm just clocking up the years, yeah?<lf>But I've got experience to impart. To<lf>those who are receptive anyway...
<string>If you feel like you need some refreshers,<lf>just say the word. I'll throw everything I've<lf>got at you, yeah?
<string>Utsushi's quite the hustler, yeah?<lf>I only knew he was there because he<lf>wanted me to know he was there.
<string>Didn't even make a sound. Could've put<lf>a few shurikens through me if he wanted...
<string>You can't achieve that level of stealth<lf>unless you have one hundred percent<lf>control over every muscle in your body.
<string>I know he said he was in awe of me,<lf>but the guy's got youth on his side.<lf>I'm in awe of him, yeah?
<string>I was reckless enough in my youth, yeah?<lf>Plenty of times I took a stupid risk out in<lf>the field and then got blasted for it later.
<string>Rightly so. Don't do what I did. You've got<lf>to treat life with respect, yeah? Galleus may<lf>be an ol' geezer, but listen to him, yeah?
<string>Use your head, but not for charging in.<lf>Well, I think that's enough talking from<lf>me. Go tackle some quests, yeah?
<string>This is just between you and me, yeah?<lf>Sometimes when I'm standing here, that<lf>smell from the Tea Shop...
<string>I'm always fighting the delicious temptation<lf>of that smell. If I didn't have nerves of steel,<lf>I'd be a gibbering wreck by now.
<string>Sure, I get my fill at dinner time, yeah?<lf>But I don't stuff myself silly like those<lf>fools up there.
<string>Gotta say, at this age, I thought I'd be<lf>past needing to practice self-control...
<string>Those dango are a godsend, yeah?<lf>Got nothing but respect for Azuki.
<string>All that honey... And sugar...<lf>So many different kinds... A fitting<lf>prize for any quest, yeah?
<string>...What!? Do I like sweet dango? Ha!<lf>Give me a break! I-I was just giving...<lf>I was just giving an example, yeah?
<string>Look at you now. Compared to when you<lf>first arrived here, you've really got a<lf>look of determination on your face.
<string>That's the face of experience, yeah?<lf>Good stuff.
<string>Certainly gotten a lot of good experience<lf>under your belt. Believe in yourself, yeah?<lf>Now go get to work!
<string>Gotta say, I'm impressed, yeah? Even if you<lf>had a little help from that master of yours.
<string>I almost feel sorry for the monsters 'round<lf>Kamura. Whole village is full of arse-kickers.<lf>Pardon the language, yeah?
<string>Once things settle down here, maybe I'll<lf>take Jae on a trip there to get some<lf>trainin' in. He could use it, yeah?
