<string>Could you spare a moment?
<string><NOFAC>Oh! Zenny greetings! You must be that<lf>hunter from Kamura, <PL>,<lf>is it? Welcome to my shop!
<string>Speaking of Kamura, how is Master<lf>Kagero? I owe much of who I am today<lf>to that wonderful man.
<string>He taught me about commerce and the art<lf>of swordsmanship. A rather odd combination,<lf>I know... But one necessary for merchants.
<string>While I am skilled with a blade, I would<lf>prefer that I am not forced to use one.<lf>I am more interested in helping others...
<string>So I am studying to become a doctor.<lf>However, I must first have the means<lf>to financially support my studies...
<string>Once I have done so, I will join my master<lf>in his travels. So, please, I invite you to<lf>stop by anytime!
<string>Oh, I almost forgot! Kagero and I have<lf>added a marvelous new feature to the<lf>lottery! You simply MUST try it!
<string>Now, when you try your luck, there is<lf>a chance that a Snowy Cohoot may appear!
<string>And when it does, you may or may not<lf>be rewarded with Lucky Balls! The more<lf>of these fortuitous orbs you collect...
<string>The more points you'll earn towards a prize.<lf>And might I say, there are many a wonderful<lf>prize to be had! Interesting, yes?

<string>Could you spare a moment?
<string><NOFAC>It appears that you've found a suitable<lf>location for a sub-camp in the Jungle!
<string>Unfortunately, the team tasked with getting<lf>it set up is having trouble with some local<lf>wildlife. Hermitaurs to be exact.
<string>Those cursed carapaceons stand in<lf>the way of many lucrative materials,<lf>and as a merchant, I cannot allow it!
<string>If you would be so kind to deal with<lf>the Hermitaur in the area, the team<lf>can get the sub-camp set up!
<string>Zenny thanks for your help!
<string><NOFAC>Thanks to you, the materials are safe...<lf>Oh! AND the team was able to continue<lf>their work! Hehehe...
<string>The sub-camp should be ready by the time<lf>you set out on your next quest!
<string>I hope that you find it useful in your<lf>resource gathering endeavors and in<lf>your monster hunting endeavors, as well!
<string>There is something I wish to discuss.
<string><NOFAC>Zenny greetings, <PL>! I see<lf>that you have found a suitable location<lf>to set up a sub-camp in the Citadel!
<string>A new sub-camp... What a fortuitous<lf>opportunity! And a lucrative one, as well!
<string>Unfortunately, that area is crawling<lf>with Boggi. I think you see where<lf>this is going, yes?
<string>If we are to seize this opportunity, those<lf>bothersome Boggi must be dealt with!<lf>Hurry, Hunter! There is zenny to be made!
<string>Zenny thanks for your help!
<string><NOFAC>Wonderful. Simply wonderful! Thanks<lf>to you, the team was able to complete<lf>their work!
<string>The sub-camp should be ready by the time<lf>you set out on your next quest! I must<lf>admit, you're quite the inspiration!
<string>Perhaps I should take a break and get<lf>in a quest or two myself. Would you<lf>mind the shop while I'm gone?
<string>I was wondering if I could<lf>ask a favor!
<string><NOFAC>I've been researching this medicine for<lf>ages and I'm in need of some ingredients.<lf>I have all but one on hand...
<string>Perhaps you could help me. You see, I'm<lf>in need of a single Sprout, and not just any<lf>will do, no! I need an Exquisite Sprout!
<string>I've already made arrangements at the Smithy<lf>for a special weapon upgrade. Once the goods<lf>are delivered, the upgrade is yours!
<string>*sigh* My master won't be pleased with me<lf>sending you out to gather my ingredients,<lf>but I can't just leave the shop unattended!
<string>You are a lifesaver!
<string><NOFAC>Now my research may continue! I can't<lf>thank you enough for procuring the<lf>ingredients for me!
<string>And remember that arrangement I mentioned<lf>before? All you need to do now is speak with<lf>Minayle and she'll "bang it out" for you!
<string>Once you're done spending zenny at<lf>the Smithy, I do hope you'll come by<lf>and spend some here, as well!
<string>Zenny greetings, <PL>!<lf>How are you getting acquainted with<lf>Elgado?
<string>While this maybe be a simple outpost,<lf>I think you'll find it has many a wonderful<lf>thing to offer!
<string>And should you require anything to make<lf>your stay more agreeable, the market is<lf>open to accept your zenny!
<string>Going back to Kamura, so soon,<lf><PL>?
<string>Oh, Master Utsushi has summoned<lf>you for training? Kagero tells me he's<lf>a rather dedicated mentor. Is that so?
<string>Well, as much as I would like to chat<lf>with you further, it's best not to keep<lf>him waiting. Safe journey!
<string>Oh, before you go! Could I interest you<lf>in something for the long journey? Perhaps<lf>a souvenir for your dedicated master?
<string>Perhaps I am mistaken, but weren't<lf>you just here? Oh, you've gone and<lf>come back, already?
<string>That's rather impressive of you! AND<lf>efficient! Yes, yes, in these difficult<lf>times, there is no time to waste!
<string>Having said that, I won't waste anymore<lf>of your time with small talk. Let the zenny<lf>spending begin!
<string>Isn't our Chichae just wonderful? Such<lf>a brave and hard-working young lady.<lf>Everyone in Elgado simply adores her.
<string>Truly a woman of her people. Leaving<lf>behind her safe and quiet castle life really<lf>means a lot to those stationed here.
<string>She's basically the pillar supporting all of<lf>Elgado. I have to make sure nothing happens<lf>to her, or else, everything would collapse.

<string>That's a first. I've never heard Admiral<lf>Galleus shout in such a manner before.<lf>The man barely speaks, let alone shouts!
<string>The wise Admiral does not strike me as<lf>a man who easily loses his cool. Perhaps<lf>he needed to make his message heard.
<string>And I'm fairly sure the entire outpost<lf>heard! Why, his voice was so loud that<lf>some of the new items on display fell over!
<string>Which reminds me, I must stop my gossiping<lf>when you're here to spend zenny! By all<lf>means, spend, spend, SPEND!
<string>Masterfully done, <PL>!<lf>I expected nothing less from a top-notch<lf>hunter from Kamura!
<string>I can tell by the look in your eyes that<lf>perhaps we have yet to see your full<lf>potential!
<string>And you won't reach it with an empty<lf>item pouch and full zenny purse! So...<lf>Can I interest you in anything?
<string>One of the Three Lords! How exciting!<lf>But there is cause for concern...
<string>The Three Lords are the fiercest of the<lf>Kingdom's monsters! But if Admiral Galleus<lf>has put his faith in you, so shall I.
<string>Now, make sure that you prepare well<lf>before departing! Is there anything that<lf>I can interest you in? Potions, tranqs...?
<string>I see that Bahari is back in Elgado.<lf>I was wondering when he would return!<lf>He's been away for some time now...
<string>He's always running off on his own, never<lf>telling a soul where he's going. Drives<lf>the other researchers mad!
<string>I can understand their frustration, considering<lf>my own master's absence. But still, one can't<lf>help but to admire his dedication to his craft!
<string>Oh—! Zenny greetings, <PL>!<lf>Forgive me for being jumpy, I'm a little—<lf>how do you say?—creeped out.
<string>Those...creatures that Bahari found.<lf>Heh. A-Aren't they...um, fascinating...?<lf>Oh, who am I kidding? *ick*
<string>I don't care how much zenny one has,<lf>you couldn't pay me to touch one!<lf>Bahari on the other hand...
<string>So, Malzeno is the monster the Kingdom's<lf>been after for years, right?
<string>I'm afraid I do not know much about it...other<lf>than its head would fetch a high price in the<lf>Kingdom. I suppose my master would, but...
<string>Unfortunately, it's rather difficult to learn<lf>from your master if they are never around<lf>to teach you... Hahaha.
<string><VO:SER>How is Lady Fiorayne? I'm afraid I haven't<lf>progressed in my studies enough to help<lf>her... I do hope she will recover soon.
<string><VO:NOR>If only my master were around— Hm?<lf>You're looking for some kind of amazing doctor?
<string>Oh, um...I see. Yes, yes. A brilliant idea.<lf>Of course... Oh, me? Oh, don't mind me!<lf>I just hadn't... *ahem*
<string>Now, don't let me keep you! Please go do<lf>whatever's necessary to help Lady Fiorayne!
<string>So you've finally met my master at last!<lf>Yes, Doctor Tadori is my master! Haha.<lf>Surprised?
<string>Isn't he incredible? He's already solved<lf>the mystery of Fiorayne's illness and is<lf>preparing a cure! Incredible indeed!
<string>I'm sure that Lady Fiorayne will be back<lf>on her feet in no time! No time at all!
<string>What an ingenious idea! I would have never<lf>imagined a cure for poison is MORE poison!<lf>*sigh* I still have so much to learn!
<string>Lady Fiorayne's condition is sure to<lf>improve now. No question. I have<lf>complete faith in my master's abilities!
<string>We may all rest easy knowing the patient's<lf>in the doctor's hands! Having said that, can<lf>I interest you in anything?
<string>I hear Lady Fiorayne's bounced back<lf>brilliantly! That is simply wonderful news!
<string>I never once doubted my master's abilities,<lf>but still, it's rather surprising to see her<lf>up and about!
<string>And now you two are off to face Malzeno.<lf>I'm at a loss for words. All I can do is wish<lf>you luck and ask that you do be careful.
<string>What wonderful news, <PL>!<lf>You've done it! You've defeated Malzeno!<lf>I cannot wait to tell Kagero!
<string>The next time I see him, I'm going to tell<lf>him every— Oh, wait... I suppose he knows<lf>already. Well, fantastic work, nonetheless!
<string>I'm sure that encounter must have taxed<lf>your item pouch and filled your zenny purse!<lf>Perhaps I can interest you in something?
<string>What strange weather... It's certainly<lf>gotten dark all of a sudden, has it not?
<string>I heard from Doctor Tadori what those...<lf>creatures did. As if they couldn't get any<lf>more loathsome... Ugh.
<string>I'm sure Bahari is working tirelessly to <lf>get to the bottom of this... In the <lf>interim, can I interest you in anything?
<string>Never in my wildest dreams could I imagine<lf>that the monster in those stories exists...<lf>Much less be the source of all this chaos!
<string>Well, they do say there's no smoke without<lf>fire. And we have Bahari's tireless efforts<lf>to thank for getting us this far.
<string>And yours, too, of course! Which reminds me!<lf>This will be quite the hunt, <PL>!<lf>Aren't you short of a few items?
<string>Hahaha! For once, I'm not asking to drum<lf>up business. I just wanna make sure you<lf>are properly prepared! ...Honest!
<string>Well, the weather has certainly improved,<lf>hasn't it? And the view from my shop is<lf>lovelier than ever!
<string>From here I can take in all of Elgado's<lf>splendor against the blue skies and<lf>towering mountains.
<string>I must admit all this beauty makes it rather<lf>difficult to focus on my merchant duties.<lf>But now that things have quieted down...
<string>Perhaps I may resume my studies with Doctor<lf>Tadori. No interruptions, please! Unless, of<lf>course, you wish to spend some zenny!
<string>It's been some time since I've met Master<lf>Kagero. I hope he's doing well in Kamura.<lf>...He is? That's great to hear!
<string>I've known him for such a long time. He's<lf>always been a wonderfully kind mentor<lf>that I have the utmost respect for.
<string>And my master, as well. I am fortunate<lf>and grateful for the opportunities they<lf>have both so graciously given me.
<string>Look at me talking about myself when<lf>you're here to spend zenny! By all<lf>means, spend, spend, SPEND!
<string>It must be rather odd to imagine Kagero<lf>as a master of the blade having only<lf>known him as a merchant.
<string>Yet when I think of Kagero, I find it <lf>odd that he now spends his days as a<lf>merchant! Yes, odd indeed!
<string>How times have changed! I wonder if<lf>perhaps he'll ever pick up a weapon<lf>again. Only time will tell...
<string>I haven't met my master for some time<lf>now. I wonder how he's faring...
<string>I do hope I may meet him again soon.<lf>I have so many questions and there's so<lf>much that I wish for him to teach me—
<string>Look at me going on about a person you've<lf>yet to meet when you're here to spend zenny!<lf>By all means, spend, spend, SPEND!
<string>Zenny greetings, <PL>!<lf>Can I interest you in anything?
<string>Oh? You'd like to know about this book?<lf>Well, it's a book about alchemy and<lf>medicines. Quite fascinating!
<string>I'm rather fond of studying, so I try to<lf>find time to study in between <lf>customers or when business is slow.
<string>And since my master is always away,<lf>I have to be proactive or else I'll never<lf>learn anything...
<string>It's so good to see my master again.<lf>I'm not sure he feels the same, though!<lf>Hahaha!
<string>Ever since he's returned I have been<lf>bombarding him with questions. But he's<lf>very patient and answers everything I ask.
<string>It only inspires me to learn more! And<lf>the only way to do that is to earn more!<lf>So...can I interest you in anything?
<string>I was discussing some of my studies with<lf>Doctor Tadori the other day, and I began<lf>to wonder about something...
<string>What kind of mentoring did Doctor Tadori<lf>have and what was his master like?
<string>I mean, to have shaped such a great<lf>student... They must've been incredible!<lf>So I asked Doctor Tadori about it.
<string>And he said that he was self-taught!<lf>Self-taught!? Can you believe it!? All that<lf>knowledge! All that skill! All that wisdom!
<string>That means I can do it, too— Wait, wait,<lf>wait. I hope that he's not trying to make<lf>me self-reliant so that he can leave again!
<string>Is that what I think it is?
<string><NOFAC>Zenny greetings, <PL>!<lf>I see you have found a rather interesting<lf>artifact. Mind if I take a look?
<string>Hmmm... I see! Mmmmhmmm...<lf>Quite fascinating!
<string>Master Kagero had told me about <COL RED>Old<lf>Messages</COL> like these.
<string>Their rarity has made them quite valuable<lf>and highly sought-after.
<string>I was hoping that I would one day come<lf>across such a treasure and, well...<lf>Here we are.
<string>These are not easy to find, either! You are<lf>quite fortunate to have found this one!
<string>If you were to come across others, I'd be<lf>delighted to see them and I'll gladly<lf>reward you for showing me.
<string>Well then, I wish you luck finding them<lf>and thank you in advance!
<string>Is that what I think it is?
<string><NOFAC>Zenny greetings, <PL>! I see<lf>that you've collected enough notes to form<lf>a complete Message. May I have a look?
<string>Mmmhmm... Mmmhmm...
<string>I see, I see...
<string>Huh, you don't say!
<string>Well now... That was a rather fascinating<lf>read.
<string>Here's that little gift I mentioned. Do<lf>take care of it, you won't find anything<lf>like it anywhere!
<string>Zenny greetings, <PL>!<lf>I see you've come across a few more notes!
<string>You've quite the collection now! I'd say<lf>you've earned yourself a break!
<string>Thanks to your efforts, I've gotten to read<lf>such fascinating material, certainly<lf>nothing like the fare I usually read!
<string>It almost makes me want to head out into<lf>the field myself! But who am I kidding?<lf>I'm not going anywhere...
<string>Unless... You wouldn't mind watching the<lf>shop— No? Oh, OK... Well, nevertheless,<lf>thank you for all your hard work!
<string>Is that what I think it is?
<string><NOFAC>Zenny greetings, <PL>! I see<lf>that you've collected enough notes to form<lf>a complete Message. May I have a look?
<string>Mmmhmm... Mmmhmm...
<string>I see, I see...
<string>Huh, you don't say!
<string>Well now... That was a rather fascinating<lf>read.
<string>Here's that little gift I mentioned. Do<lf>take care of it, you won't find anything<lf>like it anywhere!
<string>Is that what I think it is?
<string><NOFAC><PL>! That Old Message you have<lf>there! You must show it to Kagero!
<string>I'm sure he would be simply delighted to<lf>examine such a wonderous artifact! 
<string>Could you spare a moment?
<string><NOFAC>Zenny greetings, <PL>!<lf>I've added some new goods for<lf>your perusal.
<string>They say you have a fiery spirit that<lf>burns inside you, but does it burn in<lf>your pockets, as well!?
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>Could you spare a moment?
<string><NOFAC>Zenny greetings, <PL>!<lf>An associate of mine has informed me<lf>of a new way to use the Melding Pot.
<string>Only certain materials may be used, but<lf>the outcome is more than worth it.
<string>But don't take my word for it, why don't<lf>you try it out for yourself?
<string>Is that what I think it is?
<string><NOFAC>Zenny greetings, <PL>!<lf>I believe you have come across something<lf>rather interesting, yes?
<string>I'm referring to the <COL RED>MP Accelerant</COL> you<lf>have in your possession. It's quite<lf>valuable among us Wyverians.
<string>I must say that's an impressive haul you<lf>have there. I'm actually quite stunned to<lf>be honest.
<string>Using MP Accelerant with the Melding Pot<lf>"accelerates" the process allowing you to<lf>instantly claim your talismans.
<string>Why not try it out for yourself?
<string>Is that what I think it is?
<string><NOFAC>Zenny greetings, <PL>!<lf>I believe you have come across a rather<lf>interesting <COL RED>Melding Solution</COL>!
<string>A solution that will do wonders for<lf>the Melding Pot!
<string>But it won't do you any good in your<lf>pockets...
<string>Why not try it out for yourself?
<string>Zenny greetings, <PL>!<lf>I would like to thank you for being such<lf>a loyal customer to my humble little shop.
<string>To express my gratitude, I've prepared<lf>a gift for you. I hope that it lifts your spirits<lf>and loosens your purse strings!
<string>Don't run off just yet, <PL>!
<string>You'll be happy to know that you are<lf>Grand Prize Winner No. {0}!<lf>Zenny congratulations to you!
<string>A wonderous stroke of luck, truly! And<lf>a well-deserved gift for all of your<lf>efforts...and spending, if I might add!
<string>As a celebratory prize, please accept<lf>this trinket. Come by and try your luck<lf>again soon!
