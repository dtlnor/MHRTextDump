<string>The name's Jae, Admiral Galleus's future<lf>right-hand man, and knight of the Royal<lf>Order!
<string>No way... Are you...? Are you the "Fierce<lf>Flame of Kamura Village"?
<string>Whoa! Sorry for not introducing myself<lf>sooner! I can't wait to see you in action!
<string>So <PL>, how's Elgado?<lf>Everything to your liking!?
<string>Oh, you haven't had a chance to look<lf>around yet? Sorry, I got a little ahead<lf>of myself...
<string>At the very least, I can guarantee you'll<lf>learn a lot working alongside Admiral<lf>Galleus!
<string>Yo, <PL>! Heading out already?
<string>You're heading...home!? Already!? Hmmm...<lf>Perhaps the true strength of the "Fierce<lf>Flame" lies in Kamura Village...
<string>As much as I like to go with you, I'm<lf>needed here... Someone has to keep<lf>this place safe! Take care out there!
<string>"I bid thee welcome to Elgado Outpost!"
<string>Sorry, I was just working on my formal<lf>greetings. You know us knights have<lf>to be all proper and stuff!
<string>Kinda lame, if you ask me— Nnngh! Gotta<lf>be careful! If Fiorayne hears me say that,<lf>I'll never hear the end of it!
<string>I've been training and patrolling every<lf>day to live up to my title of "Knight of<lf>the Royal Order".
<string>Luchika's been hitting the books hard<lf>lately. But for me, I hate studying...<lf>Reading is so boring!
<string>That's why I'm gonna keep gettin' buff, so<lf>I can be strong enough to fight off anything<lf>that threatens Elgado!
<string>Whoa! You're so lucky! You got a personal<lf>request from the Admiral to hunt a Blood<lf>Orange Bishaten!
<string>But, man... I've never seen him so angry...<lf>Maybe he can teach me someday too!<lf>......
<string>Uh... Please forget I said anything!<lf>I was just thinking out loud, that's all!<lf>OK! Time for you to get going! Heh...
<string>Welcome back! So, the Admiral decided<lf>a course of action, huh? He looks so cool<lf>handing out orders!
<string>"We cannot overlook any potential impact<lf>of these Kingdom monsters. As a knight<lf>of the Royal Order, I will do my duty."
<string>Hehehe. So, how'd I sound? Cool, right?<lf>Ah, man. Wish I could grow a beard...<lf>then I can sound cool AND look cool!
<string>Whoa! One of the Three Lords!?<lf>I'm so pumped! But...
<string>Wish the Admiral would send ME on<lf>an urgent quest... These muscles are<lf>going to waste!
<string>But you just wait! Someday it'll be me<lf>and my muscles being sent out on all<lf>the urgent quests! You'll see!
<string>I see that Bahari is back!<lf>I'm so glad he's OK...
<string>You know, Elgado would never be what it is<lf>today, without Bahari! A lot of the facilities<lf>here are his ideas! Pretty neat, huh?
<string>But a lot of people don't like that he runs<lf>off and does his own thing. But he'd never<lf>leave us hanging! I hope...
<string>I heard you captured some Qurio!<lf>Those things sure do give me the creeps!
<string>But not Bahari! He's super excited to research<lf>'em! He's acting like it's his birthday! Wait—<lf>It's NOT his birthday, is it?
<string>Anyway, I'll leave all that brainy stuff to<lf>Bahari. I gotta get back to training so<lf>I can get super-ripped like the Admiral.
<string>I guess Fiorayne was able to get away relatively<lf>unharmed because she's been training so<lf>much. Her muscles must've protected her.
<string>But you know what I think is weird?<lf>Knowing where Malzeno is but not<lf>going after it...
<string>That must have been a tough decision to<lf>make... I guess that's why Admiral Galleus<lf>is admiral! Man, he's so cool!
<string><VO:SER>This can't be!<lf>It's Fiorayne, she's collapsed!
<string>I'm no doctor, but I have to do something...<lf>If there is anything I can do to help,<lf>just say the word...
<string><VO:NOR>...I know! I'll go get some wet towels<lf>to cool her fever!
<string>And some water so I can wring out towels!<lf>Alright, I'm on it!
<string>I'm so glad to hear Fiorayne's doing OK...
<string>Thank you <PL>, for<lf>gathering the ingredients for her medicine.
<string>When I was tending to her, she looked<lf>like she was in a lot of pain. She must've<lf>had it rough...
<string>Ah yeah! Fiorayne is back on her feet! I'm<lf>so glad. Wet towel duty was getting crazy.<lf>I must've used like a hundred towels!
<string>I made sure to place the towel gently<lf>on her forehead so not to wake her.<lf>See, these muscles do come in handy!
<string>I just wish I could use 'em to defeat that<lf>scoundrel, Malzeno... You too, right?
<string>With all the monsters you've hunted I bet<lf>you're totally ripped! You wanna have a<lf>flexin' contest? Not a good time? Yeah...
<string>Congratulations on bringing down Malzeno!<lf>But with a name like "the Fierce," I wouldn't<lf>expect anything less!
<string>But there's something bothering<lf>Admiral Galleus. Is there something<lf>we're all missing?
<string>This is making my head hurt... But maybe<lf>that's good. No pain, no gain, right?<lf>Maybe if I think more...I'll get smarter!
<string>Man... What's up with the weather today?
<string>Bahari said it was gonna be all nice<lf>and sunny. His weather reports are<lf>never wrong...
<string>Man...something is up. I just know it!<lf>I can feel it in my muscles!
<string>Is it true!? Is there really a fairy-tale monster<lf>out there? How can we take on a magical<lf>monster!? I don't know magic, do you!?
<string>Well, this is no time to show weakness!<lf>Admiral Galleus never doubts himself,<lf>and so neither shall I!
<string>If you don't try, you don't succeed!<lf>Nothing lost is nothing gained!
<string>So...<PL>. I guess we need to<lf>start learning magic! I'll ask Bahari if<lf>he has any books.
<string>Oh, the tales they'll tell! "The hunter who<lf>slayed a magic fairy-tale monster and<lf>saved the Kingdom without any magic!"
<string>So, you think you'll stick around when this<lf>is all over, <PL>? You will,<lf>won't you? At least I hope so...
<string>You'll stay!? Awesome! There's still so<lf>much I need to learn from you! Like,<lf>hunting tips, your workout routine...
<string>But... Is it OK if I still think Admiral Galleus<lf>is cooler than you? Sorry...
<string>So like, I've only recently been assigned<lf>to Elgado. I'm still kinda new to this whole<lf>being a knight thing...
<string>I'm the youngest person to graduate as<lf>a knight of the Royal Order. But I've still<lf>got a long way to go.
<string>So I guess we're both in the same boat,<lf>eh? Newcomers to Elgado!
<string>The Admiral is strict, strong, and<lf>incredibly cool. I've admired him<lf>long before I became a knight.
<string>My parents didn't want me to join the Order,<lf>said it would be too dangerous. But over<lf>time they finally accepted it.
<string>I worked hard everyday to improve<lf>my strength, and through proper dieting,<lf>molded a more muscular body.
<string>I honestly couldn't believe it when<lf>I was assigned to Elgado. I have so<lf>much respect for Admiral Galleus!
<string>Hey <PL>, check out my hair.<lf>Notice anything different?
<string>That's right! I went ahead and shaved<lf>the sides off! Now I look just like<lf>Admiral Galleus!
<string>But don't tell the Admiral about this, OK?<lf>Why? Because I don't want him to think<lf>I'm a fanboy!
<string>Have you met Gatlyn yet? She’s a member<lf>of the research team.
<string>She and I are similar in many ways,<lf>we both get really excited when we<lf>start talking.
<string>But if we talk for too long, I can feel<lf>Luchika's stare piercing deep into my<lf>soul, ordering me to get back to work...
<string>Admiral Galleus puts a lot of trust in Fiorayne.<lf>I really admire her a lot. Not just because of<lf>her close relationship with the Admiral...
<string>But because she's so amazing that she's<lf>worthy of the Admiral's trust! She has<lf>some crazy skills, too!
<string>I hope that one day the Admiral will recognize<lf>me like he does Fiorayne. If he does, then<lf>maybe I can be his right-hand man!
<string>I've just realized something. Not only is<lf>Admiral Galleus a skilled knight and leader,<lf>he's also, like, super intelligent!
<string>As for me, my brain is the only muscle<lf>that doesn't get much exercise. Your<lf>brain is, uh, a muscle, right?
<string>Anyway, it's no wonder Luchika always<lf>gets mad at me when I don't hit the<lf>books...
<string>So I've made up my mind. I'm gonna start<lf>studying so that even my brain muscle<lf>is super ripped!
<string>I'll ask Luchika to help me out!
<string><VO:SER>Wait, so is there really more to that<lf>fairy tale!? And there's a Demonlord...<lf>And that Demonlord is Malzeno!?
<string>I-It's just too much for me to take in, yo!<lf>But there's one thing I know for sure!
<string>And that's that Elgado will NEVER lose!<lf>Every time I look at my bulging pecs,<lf>I am reminded of this unavoidable fact.
<string>Do you remember what the Admiral told<lf>Fiorayne? It was really inspirational!
<string>He told her to "be proud." That's pretty much<lf>the same as saying "be swole," right? Sounds<lf>nearly identical!
<string>I'm gonna make sure to train every day<lf>so I can be just as swole as the Admiral!
<string>Put everything you got into everything<lf>you do! And do it while flexin'!
<string>I've gotta train even harder if I'm ever gonna<lf>be the Admiral's right-hand man! Bring on<lf>the pain, Master Arlow!
<string>Way cool!
<string>Yo, <PL>! Thanks a bunch<lf>for saving Bahari!
<string>He's real smart. Like WAY smart! But he's<lf>a bit of a free spirit. Definitely not the<lf>easiest to deal with...
<string>Oh, man. He's always leaving the Outpost<lf>and causing trouble for Admiral Galleus.<lf>Wish he'd think about the Admiral more—
<string>*ahem* Er, I mean, I wish he'd think about<lf>his responsibility more... Heh. Anyway...<lf>For saving Bahari...
<string>I have a little gift for ya! It's a Cohoot<lf>outfit based on the armor worn in the<lf>Kingdom a long time ago!
<string>And about that little slip of the tongue<lf>back there... Please keep it between us!<lf>Don't tell a soul, pleeeeeease!
<string>Let's hang out and do some huntin'!
<string>Oh, <PL>, great!<lf>There's somethin’ I wanna ask you.
<string>You think it would be cool if we could<lf>go out and get a little huntin' action in?<lf>I heard you got some crazy skills!
<string>They told me I need a lot more experience. And<lf>who better to learn from than you!? Especially<lf>if I'm ever gonna be cool like the Admiral.
<string>Which is why I was thinkin’ I should<lf>hang out with you and learn all the<lf>Kamura ace's tricks!
<string>I already put up the quest details, and<lf>I'm ready whenever you are. There'll be<lf>somethin’ in it for you too, of course!
<string>You're the best!
<string><PL>!<lf>Thanks for doin' me that favor.
<string>Man, those monsters with their tricky moves<lf>always mess me up...
<string>But now that I've peeped your style,<lf>I think I can handle them proper.
<string>And thanks to you, I'm one step closer<lf>to bein' as cool as the Admiral!
<string>I've still got a lot more trainin' to do.<lf>But I'm gonna get there. Just you wait!
<string>Let's hang out and do some huntin'!
<string><PL>!<lf>I've got another favor to ask!
<string>Yo, I hate these Basarios. I always get<lf>messed up trying to hunt these things...
<string>So I was hopin' that maybe if I hang with<lf>you, and we hunt one together, I can learn<lf>how to handle 'em.
<string>The quest's already up, and if you help<lf>me out, I'll never ever forget, promise!
<string>Wait... Oops! Looks like I actually posted<lf>a quest with two of 'em. Guess I got a little<lf>trigger happy? You'll still help, won't you?
<string>You're the best!
<string>Wow, thanks, <PL>!
<string>Yo! *I'm* gonna be Admiral if I keep<lf>watching you! I'm learning all the tricks!
<string>And you gotta show me more of 'em!<lf>Please, <PL>!
<string>I'm throwing myself into my training<lf>every single day so I turn out as<lf>lean and mean as the Admiral!
<string>Let's hang out and do some huntin'!
<string><PL>!<lf>Awesome timing!
<string>Master Arlow told me that you were taught<lf>by Master Utsushi back in Kamura!
<string>Man! If he taught you all your tricks,<lf>he must be, like, a proper master!
<string>I would LOVE to see him hunt! Do you<lf>think we could hang out sometime?
<string>Say you'll ask him. Come on, please!<lf>Invite Master Utsushi so the three of us<lf>can hang out and go huntin'!
<string>You're the best!
<string>YO! Thank you so much settin' that up!<lf>Master Utsushi was goin' to town out<lf>there!
<string>And you know, I can tell he's, like,<lf>really proud of you. I bet everyone<lf>from your village is.
<string>I hope I can make everyone proud of<lf>me like that some day.
<string>But you know, I will! I'm gonna become<lf>a proper knight and make the Admiral,<lf>Master Arlow, and everyone proud of me!
<string>And you too. You'll see.<lf>...Just keep inviting me on quests, OK?
