<string>You want to go hunting?
<string><NOFAC>Hey, <PL>. Would you like<lf>to go out hunting together?
<string>Hey, don't give me that look! I can do more<lf>than just sit here and snack on dango!
<string>And besides, it's good practice for us defenders<lf>to go out hunting, right? And as long as you're<lf>with me, everything'll be fine!
<string>Not to mention that I've wanted to go out<lf>hunting with you ever since you became<lf>a hunter.
<string>Come on! It'll be fun! I promise I won't<lf>complain about being hungry. OK?
<string>Wow! You were amazing out there.
<string><NOFAC>Wow, what a hunt, <PL>!<lf>That was so much fun!
<string>And totally different from the Rampage.<lf>A lot less chaotic, that's for sure! You can<lf>really focus on what you're doing.
<string>And I really got into it, too. Did you see me?<lf>I was totally in the zone out there!
<string>I definitely want to do that again some<lf>time. I hope you say yes!
<string>Oh, and I prepared a little something to<lf>thank you for letting me hunt with you.<lf>I hope it comes in useful.
<string>You want to go hunting?
<string><NOFAC>Oh, hey, <PL>.<lf>Are you here to ask me to go hunting<lf>with you? Please say you are!
<string>Because I can't stop thinking about it,<lf>now! I even forgot about being hungry!<lf>I know, right!? I think I'm hooked!
<string>And those post-hunt Bunny Dango!<lf>Mmm, so tasty! ...And now I'm hungry<lf>again. Hehehe.
<string>Anyway, if you want to go again, I just so<lf>happen to have another quest ready!
<string>This is so weird, usually I'm the one<lf>waving you off on quests. It feels so<lf>strange to actually be coming along!
<string>Wow! You were amazing out there.
<string><NOFAC>Mwemcom bwack *munch munch*<lf>Hehehe. Sorry, <PL>.<lf>You caught me mid-dango!
<string>You really surprised me out there. I can't<lf>believe you've gotten even better since<lf>the last time!
<string>Which got me thinking, as a Kamura defender,<lf>I have a responsibility to improve. Who knows<lf>when the next threat will show up.
<string>So if it's OK with you, <PL>,<lf>I'd like to come along with you the next<lf>time you go out hunting.
<string>I don't have much to offer skill-wise,<lf>but I'm a fast learner and I can bring<lf>snacks too! Hehehe.
<string>You want to go hunting?
<string><NOFAC>Hey, <PL>.<lf>There's something I want to discuss with<lf>you. No, it's not about Bunny Dango, silly!
<string>I hear that you've been helping Minoto<lf>with her training. That's so nice of you.<lf>How'd you get her outside? Hehehe.
<string>Anyway, she does have a tendency to<lf>overdo it, so I worry about her. Knowing<lf>you're helping is a real weight off my mind.
<string>So, I had an idea. How about the three<lf>of us go on a quest together? Minoto,<lf>you, and me!
<string>I mean, a chance like this hardly ever<lf>comes around, right? And I'd love to<lf>see how Minoto's training is going.
<string>I bought some extra Bunny Dango<lf>to bring with me too. I hope I don't<lf>eat 'em all before we leave. Hehehe.
<string>Wow! You were amazing out there.
<string><NOFAC>Thanks for letting me come along with<lf>you, <PL>.
<string>It's funny, I never thought the next time<lf>the three of us would hang out would be<lf>out hunting! Hehehe!
<string>And I finally got a chance to see your amazing<lf>skills up close, and Minoto's training has<lf>really paid off.
<string>I bet if Minoto and I had become hunters,<lf>the three of us would have been an<lf>unstoppable team.
<string>But I'm perfectly content sitting here giving<lf>out quests and eating Bunny Dango all day!<lf>Hehehe.
<string>Your strength has saved us time after time,<lf>and now it's needed elsewhere. We're sad<lf>of course, but we couldn't be prouder!
<string>I hope you make the same sort of splash<lf>outside of Kamura, too. No, a bigger<lf>splash! The splashiest of splashes!
<string>Still, come back and send some of that<lf>splash our way from time to time, OK?
<string>I'll be spraying—uh, I mean praying for<lf>your safe return. Happy hunting!
<string>Oooooh, hey, <PL>.<lf>It's good to see you back in town!
<string>How are things over in Elgado? Have<lf>you gotten used to it yet?
<string>I know I haven't gotten used to you<lf>not being here... But I'm glad you're<lf>out there doing your thing!
<string>And speaking of, seems like the things<lf>you do have improved! I guess fighting<lf>tougher monsters will do that, huh?
<string>Either way, I'm impressed. Which is saying<lf>a lot considering all of the impressive<lf>things you've already done. Hehehe.
<string>So now that Kamura is working with Elgado<lf>to investigate monsters from the Kingdom,<lf>everyone's wanting to get in on the action!
<string>Even Elder Fugen's all fired up! Hehehe.<lf>Just the other day, I saw him whip out<lf>his swords and bust a few moves!
<string>You know what they say, you can take<lf>the hunter out of the hunt, but you can't—<lf>oh, you know what I mean.
<string>Either way, I'm impressed. Which is saying<lf>a lot considering all of the impressive<lf>things you've already done. Hehehe.
<string>Oh, hey there, <PL>! Sounds<lf>like you've got your hands full in Elgado.
<string>I know! Once things have quieted down on<lf>your end, why don't we do some shopping<lf>together? It's been too long!
<string>We'll do a little browsing here and there,<lf>eat a few Bunny Dango, and chat the<lf>day away!
<string>It's a promise. Until then I'll be here,<lf>tapping my toes in anticipation!
<string>Welcome home, <PL>.<lf>How's hunts in Elgado?
<string>Hehehe! Like I even need to ask! Master<lf>Utsushi keeps us updated with every<lf>little detail! He even acts them out!
<string>We're all so proud of you. Especially Master<lf>Utsushi! Every time I see him, it's always,<lf>"Did you hear the gnarly news!?"
<string>So, you've added an "AND the Kingdom" to<lf>your "Savior of Kamura" title, huh? I know<lf>we can't keep you all to ourselves, but...
<string>You're like a different person from the<lf><PL> we all know. Not sure<lf>how I feel about that, to be honest...
<string>Still, no matter where you go or what<lf>you achieve, it's not like your time in<lf>Kamura will ever up and disappear!
<string>That's why you'll always be my hero,<lf><PL>. So... Welcome<lf>back, Hero of Hinoa! Hehehe.
<string>You know, at one point I wanted to quit<lf>being a quest receptionist and take up<lf>making Bunny Dango instead.
<string>Yomogi taught me how to make them;<lf>mine couldn't hold a candle to hers, of<lf>course, but they were good all the same.
<string>But then the darnedest thing happened:<lf>The moment they went on the plate—pop!<lf>They ended up right in my mouth.
<string>Every day, our friends at the Tea Shop<lf>keep their desire to eat them in check,<lf>making sweets for the rest of us.
<string>Thanks to their sacrifice, we can eat yummy<lf>Bunny Dango every day. They have my<lf>utmost respect...and continued patronage!
<string>Don't get me wrong, the Bunny Dango in<lf>Elgado are fantastic, but that first dango<lf>you eat when you get back to Kamura...
<string>*chef's kiss* They make the fatigue of any<lf>maritime voyage just melt away. I can feel<lf>my body loosen up with every bite.
<string>Then again, it might have had something to<lf>do with being super hungry. I knew I should<lf>have ordered more for the trip!
<string>Oh, <PL>! Welcome back!<lf>*grrrrrrrr*
<string>Was that my stomach!? No silly! I was<lf>just practicing my Zinogre impression<lf>Master Utsushi taught me! Hehehe.
<string>Pretty good, right? But it still needs<lf>work, so you'll have to put up with<lf>it for a bit longer, OK? "Grrrrrrrr!"
<string>I love the bustle of Elgado, but nothing<lf>beats Kamura.
<string>I had fun over there, it's just... Coming<lf>back to all the happy and familiar faces<lf>here puts my heart at ease.
<string>So make sure you soak up all these<lf>soothing smiles while you're here,<lf>OK!? Hehehe.
<string>Right after you left Kamura, Seihaku<lf>started "secretly" practicing archery<lf>with me. Hehehe.
<string>I mean, I guess it's no "secret" secret.<lf>But I'm sure Seihaku doesn't want<lf>a certain someone to know.
<string>Anyway, he's really into it! He's been<lf>practicing like crazy and has made<lf>a lot of progress!
<string>At first, he couldn't even draw the string,<lf>but he's come so far now. I almost want<lf>to give him a stronger bow!
<string>You know what? I think I'll swing by the<lf>Smithy and talk to Master Hamon before<lf>our next session. Oh, I'm so excited!
<string>Now that I've gone to Elgado a bunch<lf>of times, I've been thinking...
<string>Wouldn't it be great if everyone from<lf>the Outpost came to Kamura for<lf>a little R&R?
<string>See the roaring fires of our forges and<lf>take in some of our beautiful scenery,<lf>all while eating authentic Bunny Dango!
<string>Rice and rice balls, fish, vegetables,<lf>sweets... Oh, and Utsushi's masks...<lf>We could even turn it into a festival!
<string>You've really made a name<lf>for yourself at the Guild<lf>with all of your exploits.
<string>Hey, <PL>! Minoto told me<lf>you kicked some monster's tail. Not<lf>in those words, of course. Hehehe!
<string>And, uh, what's this about the monster<lf>looking like Master Hojo? Was it slimy<lf>and scaly or something? Oh, it was!
<string>Slimy and scaly, huh...?<lf>Was it a Mizutsune?
<string><VO:SER>So Amatsu is the monster that laid waste<lf>to Kagero and Yomogi's home...
<string>Looks like Kagero is trying his best to hide<lf>his feelings, and I have a lot of experience<lf>reading people that hide their feelings!
<string>It must be eating him up inside. Please,<lf><PL>! Defeat that monster<lf>and release Kagero from his torment!
<string>I'm pretty surprised that Yomogi remembers<lf>what happened to her when she was a baby.<lf>Must be rough...
<string>And yet she keeps working hard and smiling<lf>every day. She says she's happy because<lf>everyone here watches over her.
<string>I'm sure she must be a bit sad, but she'll<lf>be OK. Everyone here in Kamura will make<lf>sure of that! Besides, we're all family here!
<string>...And now I'm hungry! Think I'll go make<lf>sure she's financially OK by buying out all of<lf>her dango stock! Hehehe. Care to join me?
<string>First Amatsu, and now the Kingdom is<lf>facing a new variant of Malzeno. When<lf>it rains, it pours, am I right?
<string>Please, <PL>, you've gotta help<lf>the Kingdom! Only you can do it! I know<lf>you can! We all know you can!
<string>And when you make your glorious return,<lf>we'll be here waiting for you...dango in-<lf>hand! Be careful and hurry back home!
<string>You never back down from a fight, no matter<lf>how hard things get. You've given courage<lf>to so many people...
<string>And I am one of them! Thanks to you, I was<lf>able to keep smiling through the whole Ibushi<lf>and Narwa ordeal, no matter how tough it got.
<string>The fire inside you brings light to the<lf>hearts of everyone here. Every day is<lf>full of peace and happiness.
<string>A gentle flame that shines a protecting<lf>light. You are a beacon to us in every<lf>sense of the word.
