<string>So, Master Hamon's new apprentice<lf>arrived the other day.
<string>Traveled all the way from the Kingdom<lf>to study the secrets of Kamura's steel!<lf>Quite the studious young lady.
<string>Still, Kojiri was all, "You sure about<lf>this? If she learned Kamura's secrets,<lf>we're gonna lose out on some zenny!"
<string>I thought sharing knowledge with the<lf>Kingdom was a good thing, but I could<lf>see how that might put us in a bind.
<string>Didn't even cross my mind... Guess<lf>his short stature gives Kojiri a more<lf>grounded perspective.
<string>Boy, rice balls are harder to make than<lf>they look! Treat the rice too gingerly,<lf>and the things fall apart...
<string>But put too much strength into it, and<lf>they get all hard and sticky.
<string>The tasty rice balls Kojiri and Seihaku<lf>make don't fall apart in your hands, but<lf>they melt in your mouth! Witchcraft...
<string>When I asked Kojiri about it, he told<lf>me to cup two bowls together with the<lf>rice inside, and just give it a shake!
<string>I gave it a shot, and whattaya know,<lf>they came out perfectly! Boy, who'd've<lf>thunk it? Kojiri sure knows his stuff!
<string>You know how Kojiri taught me to make<lf>rice balls—with the bowls? The thing is,<lf>you can't add any filling that way.
<string>That's why I whipped up this bad boy.<lf>I call it, "Mr. Rice Vice!"
<string>You put the bowls on either side, see.<lf>Your filling of choice goes in the middle,<lf>then you flip the switch!
<string>The mechanism lines up the bowls, then<lf>shakes them in such a way as to keep<lf>the ingredients in the middle.
<string>Still, Kojiri's rice balls taste so much<lf>better... How does he do it!?
<string>So I've been working with some materials<lf>harvested from Kingdom monsters, and,<lf>MAN, this stuff is neat!
<string>I've never seen anything like it. Just<lf>thinking about the possibilities of what<lf>I can do with this stuff gets me pumped!
<string>We'll be able to offer more options going<lf>forward, and it's all thanks to you. We're<lf>grateful to you, truly.
<string>Since Kojiri won't let me sharpen the knives<lf>anymore, I spend my free time cleaning and<lf>polishing the floors here in the Prep Area.
<string>Like gear, the way to clean them differs<lf>by material. I treat the wooden floors<lf>here like I would equipment lumber.
<string>But I think I overdid it a little. I buffed<lf>the floors so much that you can slide on<lf>'em. Try to, uh, watch your step, OK?
<string>I don't want Kojiri to slip and get hurt, so<lf>I was thinking about buying some rugs.<lf>I heard Tsuriki's Pops has some for sale.
<string>Hey, <PL>! Welcome back!<lf>You've really been kicking some Astalos<lf>over there in the Kingdom, huh?
<string>I could tell because of all the new<lf>materials from Kingdom monsters<lf>coming into the village.
<string>I've been finding a lot of interesting stuff.<lf>Really gets my creative juices flowing just<lf>thinking about what I can do with it.
<string>If you have anything you want made your<lf>materials, just let me know! I'm down<lf>to get forging!
