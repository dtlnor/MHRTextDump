<string><NOFAC>Welcome home, Meowster! Starting from<lf>today, I will be your Housekeeper.
<string>You will be living in new and unfamiliar<lf>surroundings. You may rely on my paws<lf>for whatever you need!
<string>I will work hard to help you, however<lf>I possibly can! Take care out there!
<string>Meowster, what do you think of Elgado?<lf>Have you taken a shine to the place?
<string>Elgado is just an outpost, so the<lf>facilities here can be a little crude.
<string>But everyone living here is warm and<lf>friendly. I'm sure you'll fit right in!
<string>Meowster, are you taking a trip back to<lf>Kamura Village?
<string>Very good. Please take care. I'm already<lf>anticipating your return.
<string>Welcome home, Meowster. How was your<lf>visit to Kamura Village?
<string>Hmmm. The tension does seem to have<lf>faded from your face, at least a little.
<string>I will do all my paws can as Housekeeper<lf>to make your stay in Elgado pleasant.
<string>Welcome home, Meowster. Ah, one moment.<lf>The hem on your armor there has ripped.
<string>I'd love to fix it for you, but that would<lf>be asking a little too much of my paws<lf>of hospitality.
<string>Your armor keeps you alive. Go and see<lf>Minayle about it, so that it might keep<lf>you alive a little longer.
<string>Welcome back, Meowster. I heard you're<lf>headed for the Jungle, a most densely<lf>leafed location!
<string>I'm sure you can handle whatever awaits,<lf>but please prepare carefully.
<string>If you simply need a break, never<lf>hesitate to come find me. I can help<lf>you relax.
<string>Welcome home, Meowster. I've heard that<lf>the Admiral got rather upset...
<string>Concern for someone can often manifest<lf>as anger. Please keep that in mind.
<string>If you ever look to place a foot off the<lf>path, I'll be sure to put you firmly<lf>back in place, don't worry.
<string>Welcome home, Meowster. Did you make<lf>some kind of new discovery?
<string>I don't know the details, but there's<lf>something in the air in Elgado.
<string>But as Housekeeper, I try not to allow<lf>such things to cloud my duties.<lf>Take care out there!
<string>Welcome home, Meowster.<lf>Have you met Bahari?
<string>Bahari is rather amazing. Really, he's<lf>something else...in so many ways.
<string>I'm sure you'll understand before too<lf>long. In a good way! Well, take care<lf>out there!
<string>Welcome home, Meowster. You have<lf>grown accustomed to life in Elgado<lf>by now, I take it?
<string>The Admiral told me you've been<lf>entrusted with a very important quest.
<string>That's proof of the trust placed in you.<lf>Take a deep breath! Off you go!
<string>Welcome home, Meowster.<lf>Bahari has returned!
<string>He is an amazing researcher. Really,<lf>something else...in so many, many ways.
<string>Anything you find, Meowster, be sure to<lf>show it to Bahari. I'm sure he'll be able<lf>to give you some information about it.
<string>Welcome home, Meowster. I just saw Bahari,<lf>actually. Has something good happened?
<string>Bahari looked rather pleased with himself,<lf>that's all. Practically skipping.
<string>Oh, he's captured a new type of creature?<lf>Bahari is going to be busy! I shall prepare<lf>a plate for him.
<string>Welcome home, Meowster. I sense a certain<lf>tension in your face.
<string>I don't know what's happened, but I can<lf>provide a friendly ear if needed.
<string>Voicing your worries can ease the burden<lf>they create. Allow me to help, if I can.
<string><VO:SER>Welcome home, Meowster. You must<lf>be worried about Fiorayne. As am<lf>I, of course.
<string>Everyone in Elgado relies on Fiorayne<lf>for so much. We are all very worried<lf>about her.
<string>I will take some time to go and help<lf>tend to her. Please be careful yourself,<lf>Meowster.
<string>Welcome home, Meowster. I'm so happy to<lf>hear the medicine is working.
<string>Elgado needs both Fiorayne and you in<lf>equal measure. Please take good care<lf>of yourself.
<string>Seeing someone you care for in pain is<lf>very difficult. Just don't push yourself<lf>too hard.
<string>Welcome home, Meowster.<lf>The time has finally come.
<string>The Kingdom has long desired the defeat<lf>of Malzeno. I'm sure you're feeling<lf>considerable pressure.
<string>But don't let it get to you! I believe in you,<lf>without question. Take care out there!
<string>Welcome home, Meowster. I'm overjoyed to<lf>see your face, still flush with life.
<string>Meow, don't take on so much. Concern<lf>for my ward is a facet of my duties.
<string>I worry about you a lot, so do not forget to<lf>show your face around here from time to<lf>time, Meowster.
<string>Welcome home, Meowster. Even with Malzeno<lf>gone, the people of Elgado seem on edge...
<string>As a Housekeeper, it's my job to keep<lf>abreast of Elgado's current events.
<string>In times of unrest, it's important to stay<lf>alert and be prepared.
<string>Welcome home, Meowster.<lf>I suppose you'll be leaving again soon...
<string>But before you go I wanted to say, do not<lf>forget that we all value your safety!
<string>We are all well aware that there are things<lf>you wish to protect, but we wish to protect<lf>you, as well, Meowster!
<string>So, please...be careful out there.<lf>I'll be waiting for your safe return.
<string>Welcome home, Meowster.<lf>I heard that your mission was a great<lf>success!
<string>I didn't doubt you for a second! I knew<lf>you'd save Elgado from impending<lf>doom! I just knew it!
<string>It's my honor to welcome you back<lf>safe and sound, and to see you off<lf>again too! Stay safe out there!
<string>If you are in a need of help, please<lf>do not hesitate to let me know!
<string>I'm responsible for your comfort during<lf>your stay here. However, I must apologize,<lf>I'm not much of a cook...
<string>When it comes to food, well...<lf>Let's just say, I'd rather eat whatever<lf>Azuki prepares.
<string>I'm sure you have seen the Spelunker<lf>chuggin' around Elgado.
<string>It's useful for transporting heavy cargo<lf>here and there, and a vital means<lf>of transportation here in Elgado.
<string>Though many of us would love to go for<lf>a ride on it, unfortunately we cannot...
<string>Lately I have been attempting to improve<lf>my cooking skills so that I can provide<lf>you with better room service!
<string>But, for some reason, even the salads<lf>I make turn out bad!
<string>But I won't give up. I'll try my best to<lf>follow your lead and improve my cooking.
<string>Do you know Azuki over at the Tea Shop?
<string>She is very beautiful and speaks so<lf>politely...so...elegantly— Oh!<lf>...What was I saying?
<string>I don't have any special feelings for her,<lf>I swear! I admire and respect her hard<lf>work, that's all!
<string>You must be exhausted, Meowster. I heard<lf>from Chichae that you've been taking on<lf>many quests lately.
<string>Knowing you, I'm sure you're working<lf>your paws to the bone. Remember to<lf>take it easy once in a while.
<string>So, how about some of my homemade<lf>cooking!? I've gotten better, I promise!
<string>I have some wonderful news for you! While<lf>you've been out, I have worked diligently<lf>to improve my cooking skills!
<string>Actually, Azuki taught me how to cook,<lf>and thanks to her, I can now make soup<lf>to accompany your dango!
<string>Azuki is such a nice Felyne who is kind<lf>to me, despite my lack of cooking skills...
<string>What—!? Uh, haha... No, no, no!<lf>It's not like that at all! I just think she's<lf>nice! Honest! Don't look at me like that!
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>I have an update for you, Meowster.
<string><NOFAC>Meowster.<lf>I can now arrange for you to send out<lf>your Meowcenaries from here.
<string>You're fighting in a distant land to<lf>protect your Buddies and the village.<lf>I'll support you however I am able.
<string>If you wish to send out the Meowcenaries<lf>or collect rewards from their travels,<lf>you need only speak to me.
<string>I have an update for you, Meowster.
<string><NOFAC>Meowster.<lf>I can now arrange for you to trade with<lf>the Argosy from here.
<string>I must support your impressive respect<lf>for other cultures, however I can!
<string>If you wish to use the Argosy,<lf>you need only speak to me.
<string>I have an update for you, Meowster.
<string><NOFAC>Meowster.<lf>I can now arrange for you to contact<lf>the Buddy Dojo from here.
<string>The Buddies of Kamura Village move so<lf>differently from the knights of the Order,<lf>zipping around like the wind.
<string>That has to be result of their training<lf>in the village. Allow me to support that<lf>training, if only from the sidelines.
<string>If you wish to contact the Buddy Dojo,<lf>you need only speak to me.
