<string>So, your services are being sought from<lf>the outside now, too, are they?
<string>Good chance for you to find out what<lf>you're really made of.
<string>Do what you've got to do. Don't worry<lf>about us here.
<string>Hmph. So they use Palamutes in Elgado,<lf>too, huh?
<string>I hear that's my son and his family's<lf>influence on the Kingdom.
<string>There's something to be said for our<lf>culture being accepted elsewhere,<lf>I suppose...
<string>You know, I'm not really fond of Palamutes<lf>or Canynes... I'm sure they have their place.<lf>Just not at my side.
<string>Back again, are you?
<string>I've been hearing about your work. Impossible<lf>not to. I can't work for five minutes without<lf>Utsushi running up to me.
<string>Anyway, sounds like you're very busy.<lf>I hope you're not neglecting your equipment.
<string>How silly of me... Of course, you're not.<lf>Well, enjoy your stay.
<string>I overheard Iori, Hinoa, and Minoto<lf>jabbering away excitedly the other day.<lf>Turns out it was about Elgado.
<string>Then Yomogi and Komitsu came and<lf>joined in. You kids sure love your gossip.
<string>But I guess when you're young, everything<lf>new seems exciting.
<string>...If you have time, maybe go and tell them<lf>a story or two.
<string>As a hunter, you'll have a different perspective<lf>than Hinoa and the rest.
<string>Hunting the Three Lords must've been<lf>a tough proposition.
<string>I've seen some of their materials, so I know.<lf>None of my usual forging methods worked.<lf>You would have had to get creative.
<string>I had to adapt my old techniques to make<lf>any headway with them. Basically, I had<lf>to throw out the rule book.
<string>And if Minayle hadn't given me some<lf>guidance, I'd have been struggling a lot<lf>longer...
<string>You never stop learning, you know?<lf>But I wasn't going to waste any of that<lf>precious material you brought back.
<string>When I was younger, we never gave<lf>a second thought to the world outside<lf>Kamura. We were too busy here.
<string>But with this new generation, everyone's<lf>interested in everything beyond our borders.
<string>And now look at us. People coming and<lf>going all over the place.
<string>I suppose it's the new way of the world.<lf>Things change as the years go by.<lf>Guess I'm just old...
<string>Not long ago, Chino and Kotori arranged<lf>for a young Smithy from the Kingdom<lf>to come learn our techniques.
<string>A spritely young girl. Full of ambition<lf>and gripped her hammer with steely strength.
<string>I haven't seen anyone pick things up that<lf>fast since Nakago. It's funny, even I learned<lf>a few things from the experience.
<string>After her stay she was bound for the Outpost,<lf>so I wouldn't be surprised if you found her<lf>there with hammer in hand.
<string>If you do run into her, say hello from me.
<string>Minayle got in touch to ask if I'd like to<lf>accompany you next time you head back<lf>to Elgado. I refused, obviously.
<string>I've already taught her all I know. There's<lf>no reason for me to go. And I'm sure you<lf>don't want the baggage.
<string>I'm more worried about Mihaba. Poor kid.<lf>I stopped his training when news of the<lf>Rampage broke.
<string>And then Minayle's training took priority<lf>at the Kingdom's request. Feel bad for him...
<string>Well, I'll have plenty of time now. So<lf>I can really put him through the mill.
<string>I guess Iori might leave the village one<lf>day. Let's face it, he probably will.<lf>He's a lot like his father.
<string>Teach him what he needs to know,<lf>will you?
<string>Should be his parents' job, but they<lf>can be a little lax sometimes. I think<lf>you'd be a good mentor.
<string>Still...that's a way off, yet.
<string>Ah, <PL>.<lf>Can't you do something about that loudmouth?
<string>Utsushi, I mean. I'm glad to hear news of<lf>your work, but I don't need every single<lf>detail acted out in front of me.
<string>Maybe if you showed up a little more<lf>often, he wouldn't feel the need.
<string>What—?<lf>You see him all the time in Elgado?
<string>Hmph. I better have a word with him<lf>about letting go of his apprentices...<lf>Not that he'll listen.
<string>Tell me, <PL>, what is it that<lf>drives you to get tough?
<string>For me it was the disaster that struck<lf>the village fifty years ago. Fugen probably<lf>feels the same.
<string>Sorry, I'm just rambling. Hinoa asked<lf>me to get a new bow ready for Seihaku,<lf>and it got me thinking.
<string>People are driven by all sorts of reasons.<lf>Anyway, just the thoughts of an old man...
<string>...Back again, I see.
<string>But then heading back? I heard things<lf>have settled down a little over there.
<string>Still, you're young. You can afford to<lf>work like crazy. And you should while<lf>you still can.
<string>Anyway, be sure to look after yourself.<lf>And...show your face here from time<lf>to time, hm?
<string>So Amatsu has appeared—a threat<lf>even greater than Ibushi and Narwa...<lf>If it reaches the village, we're done for.
<string>Just when we've conquered the Rampage,<lf>another calamity to deal with... Guess we're<lf>just gonna have to stand strong.
<string>I hear Utsushi will be joining you on this<lf>hunt. Follow his lead, combine your strengths,<lf>and save the village. I have faith in you.
<string>Once again, great job, <PL>.<lf>I knew that monster would be no match<lf>for you. Calamity or not...
<string>Kagero must be relieved. To finally be free<lf>from years of agony. Can't see his face, but<lf>I'm sure there's a smile under that cloth.
<string>You've once again saved Kamura, and peace<lf>has returned once more. It's good to hear<lf>Yomogi's happy voice, too.
<string>Goin' up against that new Malzeno variant,<lf>hm? I'd love to help, but we're still dealing<lf>with the fallout that Amatsu left behind.
<string>I'm sure you and the Order can handle it fine<lf>without me. Besides you have Minayle to help<lf>"bang things out" or whatever it is she says...
<string>Either way, this is a completely new variant,<lf>so treat it as you would an entirely new<lf>monster. Stay on your toes out there.
<string>What a time to be alive. Glad I survived<lf>the Rampage fifty years ago so I could<lf>bear witness to such greatness.
<string>The legend of the Fierce... It'll be a tale<lf>to tell in the afterlife, that's for sure. I'm<lf>sure my old friends would love to hear it.
<string>Not that I'm keelin' over any time soon. Not<lf>with all these orders that still need to be<lf>made. I need at least another fifty years...
<string>I have an important matter to discuss.
<string><NOFAC>Now that the calamity no longer looms<lf>over us, I have an important matter to<lf>discuss with you.
<string>Materials from powerful monsters require<lf>quite a bit of skill to wield, but they have<lf>the potential to grant certain abilities.
<string>And Amatsu is quite the powerful monster<lf>indeed, so I should be able to forge some<lf>rather potent weapons from its materials.
<string>They should help you out on difficult<lf>hunts. If you find your weaponry lacking,<lf>you'd best try it.
