<string>A word if you would...
<string>Ah, <PL>.<lf>I was wondering if I may talk to you about<lf>something.
<string>I know we only just went out hunting<lf>together, but I'm rather interested in<lf>going out again.
<string>I've actually prepared a new quest.<lf>Chichae has it added to her list. Please<lf>have a look when you are able to.
<string>You can take your allies out on quests<lf>with you as <COLS RED>Followers</COL>, allowing each of<lf>you to hone the other's skills.
<string>I'm sure there are many here who<lf>would be interested in tagging along<lf>with the Fierce on a hunt or two.
<string>If you receive such requests, please do<lf>accept. They foster the bonds that will<lf>surely aid our cause in the end.
<string>Oh, one other thing. The Kingdom has issued<lf>a request for monster research with <COLS RED>Support<lf>Surveys</COL>. Followers can join those, as well.
<string>Anyway, I don't mean to overcomplicate<lf>things. The point is to go out and hunt<lf>some monsters together!
<string>Of course, the Three Lords and our<lf>investigations into the Kingdom monsters<lf>come first. The rest when you have time.
<string>I've updated Chichae with a new list of<lf>quests you need to prioritize. Please<lf>take a look, and I'll see you again soon.

<string>Ah, there you are. I have something urgent<lf>that needs your attention. I have received<lf>a rather distressing message from the Guild...
<string>The elder dragons, Kushala Daora, Teostra,<lf>and Chameleos have been spotted. They<lf>must be dealt with and dealt with swiftly!
<string>The Guild has requested you specifically<lf>to handle this situation. The fate of the<lf>world is in your hands...
<string>But you are not alone, my friend.<lf>We shall fight by your side as comrades!<lf>Come, let us be off!
<string>I'm most grateful.
<string>Thank you. That was time well spent.<lf>There really is no substitute for real-<lf>life combat, is there?
<string>I've a good understanding of your methods<lf>and techniques now. That'll stand us in good<lf>stead in our future endeavors.
<string>We must hunt together again should<lf>the opportunity arise. I'll be here when<lf>you're ready.
<string>Until then I have a small token of gratitude.<lf>I'm certain you'll find it useful. Please, do<lf>accept it.
<string>I'd like you to accompany me.
<string>Ah, <PL>. Thank you for coming.<lf>Forgive me, but I was wondering if perhaps<lf>you would go hunting with me again.
<string>The quest I had in mind will take us<lf>a different location at a different time.
<string>Having a variety of experiences together<lf>will only make us stronger as a team.
<string>Forgive me for seeking your company<lf>so often, but I believe it'll be beneficial<lf>to you, as well.
<string>The quest details are already available.<lf>If you'll accept, I'd be very grateful.
<string>I'm most grateful.
<string>Thank you again. That was very<lf>instructive. And renewed proof of your<lf>unwavering skill against any adversary.
<string>Kamura Hunter that was most impressive.<lf>You are indeed a grand warrior of skill<lf>and experience.
<string>I too have a reputation in the Kingdom as<lf>a great warrior. But seeing you at work<lf>gives me cause to redouble my training.
<string>Thank you once more for your fellowship.<lf>I have a small reward for you again.<lf>Please, take it.
<string>I'd like you to accompany us.
<string>My colleagues inform me that you regularly<lf>embark on the hunt with Luchika.
<string>I presume you are aware of her...um,<lf>well, you know...
<string>An exemplary knight, of course. But when<lf>faced with a monster, she becomes, hmmm...<lf>How can I say? Somewhat of monster herself.
<string>The contrast with her usual calm persona is<lf>so stark, other knights find her intimidating,<lf>especially younger ones.
<string>As a result, few will accompany her out<lf>in the field. It's a blessing that you've<lf>taken her under your wing.
<string>I've come to you now because of a quest<lf>that calls for three hunters. Invite her,<lf>and let us undertake it together.
<string>I'm most grateful.
<string>Thank you for joining me on the quest.<lf>Luchika was pleased to have been able<lf>to sharpen her skills at your side.
<string>I know her skills and her intelligence<lf>are unquestionable, so I'd like to give<lf>her the responsibility of leadership...
<string>But the younger knights especially are<lf>so taken aback by her uncharacteristic<lf>ferocity in battle.
<string>Of course, the more experienced knights<lf>simply smile and look on. Master Arlow,<lf>in particular, seems to enjoy it.
<string>I suppose it's just her nature. And until<lf>the others get used to it, I must thank<lf>you for hunting with her.
<string>I'd like you to accompany me.
<string>Ah, excellent.<lf>I was just looking for you.
<string>I met with my dear sister the other day,<lf>and we discussed the possibility of the<lf>three of us hunting together.
<string>She hasn't been able to go hunting for some<lf>time, but hearing stories of your adventures<lf>has her itching to take up arms.
<string>If you would be kind enough to invite her out<lf>on a quest, I would be most grateful. And,<lf>of course, I would be delighted to join.
<string>I'm most grateful.
<string>What a wonderful time that was.<lf>I am truly grateful for the experience.
<string>...Why the face? You think it would have<lf>been better for us sisters to go alone?
<string>I must admit, it has been some time since<lf>the two of us did anything alone. I hesitate<lf>to use the word awkward, but...
<string>I-I don't know how I feel about sharing this<lf>with you. Forgive me. Let me just thank you<lf>again for the opportunity and leave it at that.
<string>Rondine and I will be availing ourselves<lf>of Kamura's hospitality a little longer,<lf>so we'll continue to be in your debt.
<string>A moment if you would.
<string>I have a message for you from Elder<lf>Fugen. He's found a way to strengthen<lf>the weapon he bestowed upon you.
<string>However, you must complete a trial first.<lf>That is...rather harsh. But I suppose<lf>Kamura hunters are quite disciplined.
<string>The trial itself is no walk in the park.<lf>You must collect the rare scales of<lf>a Kushala Daora and a Teostra.
<string>I have a letter I'm to give you once you<lf>provide me with the scales. Be on your<lf>guard. These are elder dragons.
<string>Trial complete. Excellent.
<string>Another trial completed. Well done.<lf>As promised, here's the letter detailing<lf>how to strengthen the weapon.
<string>I believe I'm starting to understand how<lf>Kamura is able to produce hunters of<lf>such excellence.
<string>Perhaps the Knights of the Order could<lf>do with something similar. I will consult<lf>Master Arlow on the matter.

<string><VO:SER>I've been informed of the situation regarding<lf>Amatsu. I wish I could accompany you, but<lf>I'm afraid Elgado requires my presence here.
<string>And though your home is in great peril,<lf>we are all confident that you shall overcome<lf>this calamity as you have done so before.
<string>Focus on protecting your home. Worry not<lf>about us. The Order will handle things while<lf>you are away. I pray for your safe return.
<string>If you'd be so kind, could you speak<lf>with the knights stationed here? I'm sure<lf>they'd be delighted to meet you.
<string>They were all very excited to learn that the<lf>Kamura hunter known as "<PL>,<lf>the Fierce" would be coming.
<string>They're all individuals of exceptional skill.<lf>I've no doubt you'd enjoy meeting them, too.
<string>Oh, returning to Kamura Village, already?<lf>Ha! It must be difficult being so popular!
<string>Well, I suppose it must be rather tiring to<lf>stay in this unfamiliar place for such a long<lf>stint. Please, enjoy your rest at home.
<string>Ah, you've returned. And so soon after your<lf>trip to Kamura. I do apologize.
<string>I see you were accompanied by Master Arlow.<lf>Perhaps you already know, but he's been my<lf>instructor ever since I joined the Order.
<string>I'm sure he was delighted to accompany<lf>you. Inwardly, of course. He tends not to<lf>express things.
<string>I've spoken to the Admiral, and we've<lf>decided to assign this quest to you.
<string>And considering its relevance to Kamura,<lf>it only made sense to assign it to you.<lf>And then your name was put forward.
<string>Clearly you have the trust of everyone<lf>in Kamura Village.
<string>It must be a little hard for visitors from<lf>outside to adjust to the unfamiliar<lf>environment here.
<string>But I would very much like people to<lf>enjoy their time in Elgado. I'm just<lf>not sure how to make that happen...
<string>Maybe I should explain our training and<lf>hunting practices and other cultural<lf>differences. Over some dango, perhaps?
<string><VO:SER><FACE:SER>...Ah, <PL>. I must apologize<lf>for my behavior earlier.
<string>Admiral Galleus has given me similar<lf>warnings in the past at times. Though...<lf>never quite so direct.
<string>But I understand his concerns.<lf>You needn't worry.
<string>Having been hunting with you now, I see<lf>your reputation as "<PL>,<lf>the Fierce" is justified.
<string>I normally handle quests assigned to me<lf>by Admiral Galleus. And I'm reasonably<lf>confident in my own abilities.
<string>Not that I doubted yours. But now that I've<lf>witnessed what you are capable of, I must<lf>spend more time sharpening my own skills.
<string>Unbelievable...<lf>I can only apologize to you for putting<lf>you in this position.
<string>And for his behavior. He's always been<lf>like this—running off and getting himself<lf>into trouble.
<string>But as troublesome as he is, we still<lf>need him. Forgive me, but would you<lf>go out again and bring him back?
<string>Hmph. Thanks to Bahari's recklessness,<lf>what the Admiral said to me before has<lf>taken a deeper meaning.
<string>I wish he'd take this more seriously. We<lf>are dealing with the Three Lords here,<lf>the fiercest of all the Kingdom's monsters.
<string>Nevertheless, we can count on him to<lf>track them down, and when he does,<lf>he'll likely be completely fine... *sigh*
<string>I swear his luck never ceases to amaze me.<lf>Despite the grief he gives us, he always<lf>manages to come through in the end...
<string>*sigh* No use in complaining about it...<lf>Make your preparations. We depart<lf>once you're ready.
<string>Gaaaah! That man is as irritating as ever!<lf>Why won't he shut up? "aRe yOu geTtiNg<lf>eNoUgH rEsT, FiO?"
<string>I'm well aware of the importance of such<lf>things for operating at peak performance.
<string>I suppose he's merely looking out<lf>for my well-being, but...
<string>It's "the way" he says things. It...<lf>It just gets under my skin!
<string>Those creatures flying in the sky above<lf>the Garangolm... There was something<lf>disturbing about them...
<string>Could a bite from something so small<lf>really have caused such a violent turn?
<string>There are too many unanswered questions<lf>at the moment. We have to capture one,<lf><PL>. We simply can't fail.
<string>Let Bahari be. He won't eat or sleep for<lf>days now. Nothing will distract him from<lf>his work.
<string>And to think he was lecturing me about<lf>looking after my health...
<string>Lunagaron...<lf>The monster that ambushed you in<lf>the Shrine Ruins.
<string>That won't happen again. We WILL be ready.
<string>Now that we know where it is, it won't<lf>be getting the better of us. And I've no<lf>intention of being beaten.
<string>...Don't worry about me. It's but a scratch.<lf>I'll be back and ready for duty in no time.
<string>What we should worry about is that<lf>foul creature, Malzeno. We must<lf>prepare and prepare well.
<string><VO:SER>I've been a burden to everyone here.<lf>I feel terrible...
<string><VO:NOR>To think it was a blasted virus that<lf>took me out! But rest assured, I'm fully<lf>recovered now. Nevertheless...
<string>Our preparations are complete. It's time<lf>to fight back. Our duty will be fulfilled!<lf>For Her Majesty and for the Kingdom!
<string>The Kingdom's nemesis, Malzeno, defeated<lf>at last! Well done, <PL>!<lf>I cannot thank you enough.
<string>Yet...Admiral Galleus still seems troubled.
<string>And it seems he's unable to confide in me<lf>at this time. I certainly won't force the issue.
<string>If the Admiral deems it too soon to tell me,<lf>I will respect his decision. I'm sure he'll<lf>speak to me when the time is right.
<string>Peculiar...<lf>The Qurio are still active even now.
<string>Seems Admiral Galleus's judgment is<lf>as sound as ever. Despite our victory<lf>over Malzeno, he remained cautious.
<string>His instincts are impeccable. Still we've<lf>not a clue what we are really dealing with<lf>here. We must remain vigilant.
<string>There have been no reports of any new<lf>craters. And obviously no new sightings<lf>of Malzeno...
<string>What is the Qurio's ultimate goal? And<lf>now the skies have darkened, as well.<lf>Something ominous is brewing...
<string>All we can do at the moment is continue<lf>our investigations. And be certain that<lf>we overlook nothing.
<string>I must admit I'm quite shocked at what<lf>Admiral Galleus said. "The Archdemon<lf>of the Abyss..."
<string>Are we really talking fairy-tale nonsense?<lf>I mean seriously...at a time like this!?
<string>Or perhaps... Perhaps this is exactly the<lf>time we should be taking it seriously.<lf>Let us accelerate our investigations.
<string>Everything that's happened since<lf>defeating Malzeno...it's all connected.
<string>The surge in Qurio activity, Admiral<lf>Galleus's anxiety, the Archdemon<lf>of the Abyss...
<string>And now we've learned that he's had<lf>a new ship built in anticipation of this.<lf>Really... I'm lost for words.
<string>Well, fairy tale or not, we cannot just<lf>sit on our hands. The Knights of the<lf>Royal Order will win this day!
<string>But let us not forget the Admiral's wise<lf>words. No sacrifices. We all come back.<lf>Come back alive.
<string>We face an adversary of legend! But<lf>together... Together we can bring this<lf>dark chapter to a close! Let's move out!
<string>The Kingdom is safe. We're safe.<lf><PL>...<lf>We are all in your debt.
<string>But even though the Archdemon of<lf>the Abyss is no more, the threat of<lf>the Qurio's influence remains...
<string>It's truly heartening that you've agreed<lf>to stay on in Elgado. You're too kind.
<string>Your strength is an inspiration to me. I<lf>think perhaps I'll ask Master Arlow if he'll<lf>further my training. It's been too long.
<string>So the Qurio are evolving. And fast.<lf>I shudder to think what their next host<lf>could be after Malzeno...
<string>They're creatures like any other, I suppose.<lf>Just doing what they must to survive.<lf>But their method...
<string>Nonetheless, this is no time for sentiment.<lf>Any creature that threatens our Kingdom,<lf>or its allies, must be dealt with swiftly.
<string>The Wind Serpent Ibushi reported<lf>at Kamura Village. They're unusual<lf>specimens, it seems...
<string>They may be more powerful and exhibit<lf>different behavior compared to your<lf>previous encounter.
<string>...Don't push your luck here. I'm not<lf>the only one who's concerned. Everyone<lf>in Elgado is worried for your safety.
<string>Mass monster hysteria coinciding with<lf>the emergence of the Thunder Serpent<lf>Narwa...
<string>Nevertheless, we WILL stop the Rampage!<lf>As Admiral Galleus said, we owe Kamura<lf>this and we will not fail!
<string>Leave this to us. Your task is to<lf>subdue the Thunder Serpent!
<string>Bahari really has no idea. No matter<lf>the monster, you will not be bested.
<string>For some of the Knights of the Order, yes.<lf>But for you...?
<string>I have every confidence that you'll<lf>emerge victorious. Just...be cautious.
<string>...Bahari is right. The Admiral and I<lf>must direct the Elgado knights.
<string>Which leaves the hunting to you. I know<lf>it's the right division of labor, but...<lf>I'm sorry to put you in this position.
<string>Rest assured that Elgado will be safe.<lf>I know it's another perilous quest for<lf>you, but please...be careful.
<string>When Master Hamon learned of the<lf>Magnamalo variant, he got so worked<lf>up about it that Iori started to worry.
<string>The decision for you to hunt it came<lf>directly from Kamura. And... Well,<lf>I have no objection there.
<string>Still, what could have caused Master<lf>Hamon to become so upset about it...?

<string>Have you had a chance to properly explore<lf>Elgado, <PL>?
<string>There are many unique individuals here.<lf>And not just knights, fine artisans, as well.
<string>And surely you have admired the lovely<lf>view. It may be a simple outpost, but<lf>it has many wonderful things to offer.
<string>It's been some time since I arrived here<lf>with the Admiral Galleus and the Order.<lf>This "fortress," if you could call it that...
<string>Nothing more than a few structures and<lf>a pile of rubble. Rather impressive what<lf>they've done with it.
<string>I've become quite attached to Elgado.<lf>I hope you'll develop a fondness for it,<lf>too.
<string>Bahari can be very irritating, but his<lf>research work here in Elgado is vital.
<string>Being Wyverian, he's long-lived and<lf>has amassed great knowledge. And<lf>his curiosity knows no bounds.
<string>They say curiosity feeds a hunger<lf>for knowledge, just as training feeds<lf>a desire for strength.
<string>And as Bahari's curiosity is unending,<lf>he won't ever stop amassing knowledge.<lf>...And being annoying. Ugh.
<string>When I became a Knight of the Order,<lf>Master Arlow was my instructor. He<lf>himself is a knight of exceptional skill.
<string>And his training regime was rather brutal,<lf>I must say. Still is... Yet he was incredibly<lf>patient.
<string>It's no exaggeration to say that without<lf>his guidance, I wouldn't be where<lf>I am today.
<string>In other words, his methods work. If you're<lf>interested, you could ask him for some<lf>instruction, too.
<string>Admiral Galleus summoned me the other<lf>day, and to my enormous surprise, gave<lf>me an unbridled compliment.
<string>He said I'd grown. That I no longer made<lf>light of my own existence to blindly<lf>carry out my duty.
<string>And it's true that in the past I would<lf>have given literally everything to<lf>protect my Kingdom.
<string>But now it's different. I aim to protect<lf>everything. The Kingdom and myself.<lf>Because I'm part of that Kingdom.
<string>And that feels good. It feels good to value<lf>oneself. But I must admit, it's strange how<lf>our ideas change with time...
<string>Malzeno and the Archdemon of the Abyss<lf>have both been laid to rest. All thanks to<lf><PL>, the Fierce!
<string>My future in Elgado is uncertain, but as<lf>long as the Qurio's influence threatens<lf>the Kingdom I will remain here.
<string>When peace is assured, Admiral Galleus<lf>will undoubtedly receive new orders and<lf>move on to his next assignment.
<string>And I intend to follow wherever he goes.
<string>He's a wise leader who I have the utmost<lf>respect for and I will continue to support<lf>him for as long as I am able.
<string>Ah, I hear you've defeated that Amatsu.<lf>You never cease to amaze!
<string>You saved Kamura and avenged those<lf>who lost everything when Amatsu laid<lf>waste to their city.
<string>We've been waiting here eagerly for your<lf>return. It's good to see you again,<lf><PL>.
