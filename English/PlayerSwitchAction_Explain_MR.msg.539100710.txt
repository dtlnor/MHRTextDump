When your Kinsect comes<lf>in contact with a monster, it'll absorb<lf>extract.<lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Fast)
<string>A style of shooting that draws out the true<lf>potential of ammo.
<string>A special shooting style that further raises<lf>damage output but narrows critical<lf>distance and increases recoil.

<string>Fires an arrow loaded with Ironsilk.<lf><lf>If the follow-up arrow lands in the same<lf>spot as the first, Ironsilk winds around<lf>both arrows, inflicting severing damage.<lf>If the second arrow is off target, the<lf>lodged arrow disappears.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Medium)
<string>A maneuver using a Wirebug to boost bow-<lf>drawing strength.<lf><lf>Shots can be fired while evading.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Fast)
