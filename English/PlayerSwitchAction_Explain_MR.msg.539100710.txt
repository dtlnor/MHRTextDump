<string>A style of shooting that draws out the true<lf>potential of ammo.
<string>A special shooting style that further raises<lf>damage output but narrows critical<lf>distance and increases recoil.

<string>A maneuver using a Wirebug to boost bow-<lf>drawing strength.<lf><lf>Shots can be fired while evading.<lf><lf>(Wirebug Gauge recovery speed: Fast)
