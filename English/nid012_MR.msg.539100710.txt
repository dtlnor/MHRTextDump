<string>At last, the time has come for Meowster<lf>to begin a new hunting journey and venture<lf>outside the village!
<string>Meowster is a hunter of exceptional<lf>skill, I'm sure your star will shine even<lf>brighter outside the village!
<string>I wish I could be at your side, to bear<lf>witness to your bravery. Alas...
<string>I still have a very important role to<lf>play here, someone needs to take<lf>care of your things while you're gone.
<string>Please do take care of yourself, Meowster.<lf>We'll all be waiting for your safe return.
<string>Glad to see you back, Meowster!<lf>Everything here's just as you left it.
<string>Everyone has been eager to see you<lf>return safely.
<string>So it brings me great joy to be able to<lf>welcome you home once more.
<string>Please relax and enjoy yourself. I'll<lf>make you some tea. Purr-haps some<lf>Bunny Dango, as well?
<string>While Meowster is away, I have been<lf>doing my best to keep everything nice<lf>and tidy.
<string>But just the other day, a gigantic bug flew<lf>in through an open window. It was so huge<lf>and gross I almost fainted.
<string>With Miss Hinoa and Miss Minoto's help we<lf>managed to chase it out... You should have<lf>seen it. It was so gross...and slimy too!
<string>I spent hours cleaning up all the slime it<lf>left behind— Maybe I should have left<lf>that part out...?
<string>It feels like every time we meet, Meowster's<lf>meowscles are bigger than before.
<string>Purr-haps Meowster has the same work-<lf>meow-t routine as Senri?
<string>I've heard Senri's pawceps are as hard<lf>as a Basarios's behind. Is it true?
<string>Welcome home, Meowster!<lf>Please make yourself comfur-table!
<string>Since Meowster's been gone I haven't<lf>missed a single day of cleaning and<lf>organizing, I swear!
<string>For it is my duty to make sure that<lf>everything is clean and tidy for when<lf>Meowster returns!
<string>There isn't a single speck of dust any—
<string>It's nothing. You didn't see anything. You<lf>definitely did not just find a speck of dust.
<string>I purr-ay Meowster's investigation is going well.
<string>Should Meowster require anything<lf>while in town, I shall see to it,<lf>purr-sonally.
<string>I must say, I am relieved that Meowster<lf>is doing well.
<string>Meowster is an exceptional hunter,<lf>yet we are all at ease when Meowster<lf>returns home. Welcome home.
<string>Meowster, I hear you're off to take on<lf>Amatsu!
<string>"Looming Cala-mew-ty," huh? Is it really<lf>a cala-mew-ty? Seems like every other<lf>meownster that shows up is one...
<string>Either way, you worry about that meownster,<lf>I'll worry about your room. When you get back<lf>everything will be nice and tidy! Purr-omise!
<string>I was wondering where this bright light was<lf>coming fur-om, but it was you in all your<lf>splendid glory, Meowster!
<string>Only a true Meownster Hunter could defeat<lf>Amatsu that easily! Excuse me whilst I bask<lf>in your presence! *proceeds to bask*
