<string>Might you spare a moment?
<string>Forgive my asking, but have you heard<lf>of Amber Copal? It's a specialty of the<lf>Citadel. A beautiful resin.
<string>But of course dangers abound of late at<lf>the Citadel. Few hunters are gathering<lf>the resin and supplies are short.
<string>I considered asking Jae and Luchika,<lf>but both are busy with other assignments.<lf>And two I would rather not pair on a quest.
<string>So I was hoping you might oblige me in<lf>fetching some. As a reward...what would<lf>you say to an insect glaive upgrade?
<string>I thank you.
<string>You've been a tremendous help, and<lf>have alleviated the shortage. Let me<lf>express my gratitude!
<string>As for your reward, you may inquire<lf>about it at the Smithy. Please do so<lf>at your leisure.
<string>Now, I must turn my attentions back to<lf>my duties. I should check if Luchika and<lf>Jae have completed their assignments.
<string>So you're this hunter they call "the Fierce."<lf>I am Sir Ertz. Welcome to Elgado Outpost.<lf>And I mean it, most welcome.
<string>As a knight of the Royal Order, it's an<lf>honor to have one as strong as you<lf>join our cause.
<string>Dame Fiorayne speaks so highly of you.<lf>I'm expecting big things! I look forward<lf>to conducting research together.
<string>This outpost bears all the expectations<lf>of the Kingdom, operating as the front-<lf>line base for research into Malzeno.
<string>I don't mean to apply too much pressure,<lf>but Admiral Galleus hopes you'll give<lf>our results a boost. I'm hoping that too.
<string>My apologies, I'm being very stiff.<lf>Formality is baked into knights<lf>of the Order at an early age.
<string>I hope we can share a meal some time.<lf>You'll find me more relaxed with fork in<lf>hand, and I'd love to hear of your home.
<string>I've received the report. New methodologies<lf>for you will only benefit us, as well.
<string>There's no reason not to allow this.<lf>The ship is standing ready, so you<lf>may leave whenever you please.
<string>I'm glad to see you back safe and sound.<lf>Being able to coordinate with your village<lf>will be most advantageous going forward.
<string>We must face new mysteries and threats<lf>with new skills and tactics. That seems<lf>the best approach to me.
<string>The princess handles those quests with<lf>aplomb! Seeing her giving her all to such<lf>a task is most encouraging indeed.
<string>It goes beyond mere inspiration. I feel<lf>every muscle in my body rising to her<lf>call. Don't you agree?
<string>I've nothing to add to what the Admiral<lf>said. Asking this should be indication<lf>enough of the Order's faith in you.
<string>I trust that you'll respond in kind,<lf>and I believe you will.
<string>I'm a member of the Royal Order. The sense<lf>of duty Dame Fiorayne feels is something<lf>I also know, perhaps painfully well.
<string>Admiral Galleus's words touched something<lf>in me, as well. I need some self-reflection.
<string>We've set a firm course for dealing with<lf>the Kingdom monsters. The next step<lf>is for everyone to start taking on quests.
<string>The Order will be put to work as well,<lf>but having a hunter like you around<lf>is a true boon at times like these.
<string>I would lend my sword to your struggle,<lf>but I'm needed here in the case of<lf>unforeseen circumstances arising.
<string>Sorry to place this burden upon you, but<lf>please lend us your aid. My faith in you<lf>tells me you can surpass this challenge.
<string>I've read your report. As a citizen of<lf>the Kingdom, you have my thanks—and<lf>my respect, for such a display of skill.
<string>I know at least one person who should be<lf>thanking you directly, but we both also<lf>know that's unlikely to happen.
<string>Instead, allow me to thank you again for<lf>all of your aid. Well hunted, Fierce Flame<lf>of Kamura!
<string>This is it! The moment has finally come!<lf>The first of the Three Lords, Garangolm!
<string>Hunting the beast and limiting further<lf>chaos is our vital duty, but first we<lf>must also learn all we can of it!
<string>I truly believe that's the only path to<lf>reaching Malzeno!
<string>Admiral Galleus made the right decision to<lf>entrust this task to you. As a knight of the<lf>Order, that thought fills me with pride.
<string>I have also been impressed once again<lf>with your skills. A breathtaking display<lf>of hunting prowess.
<string>Word of your deeds will have reached far<lf>across the Kingdom by now. Surely every<lf>soul living will soon know your name.
<string>Some other creature is exerting influence<lf>over the Kingdom monsters? That's quite<lf>a shock!
<string>But no matter how abnormal it seems,<lf>it's also a logical conclusion drawn<lf>from investigation-based facts.
<string>So I'm going to offer my full support.<lf>Support on all fronts! Elgado must pull<lf>together and complete this research!
<string>Malzeno, the Qurio, and Kingdom monsters<lf>running wild... Where will all of these<lf>connections lead us, I wonder?
<string>Without reliable comrades, unraveling<lf>the mystery—much less facing the<lf>Three Lords—would be difficult.
<string>Still, Admiral Galleus speaks true: you<lf>must avoid any foolhardiness. Everyone<lf>must consider their own safety.
<string>Good show dealing with those aforementioned<lf>"unforeseen circumstances." I speak both of<lf>you, and of Dame Fiorayne.
<string>Even so, with the threat of Malzeno<lf>growing all too real, I suppose this is<lf>an inevitability.
<string>One could call this the earnest results<lf>of the investigations you continue to<lf>spearhead bearing fruit.
<string><VO:SER>First Malzeno appears, now things<lf>have come to this...
<string>Rondine hurried over as soon as she<lf>received the urgent report, but I can't<lf>imagine how she must be feeling...
<string>In times like this, someone in my<lf>position should reach out and say<lf>something to lift her spirits.
<string>The plague of old, is it? It happened<lf>before I was born so I never really<lf>felt much connection to it...
<string>But when I think of Dame Fiorayne<lf>having been afflicted, I feel as though I've<lf>contracted that terrible affliction myself...
<string>Coming face-to-face with such harrowing<lf>history, I am compelled to reflect upon<lf>my duty, and again screw up my courage.
<string>All of this is thanks to you. On behalf<lf>of Dame Fiorayne, allow me to offer<lf>my heartfelt gratitude.
<string>Now that we have what we need for<lf>the cure, all that's left is to hand it all<lf>over to Tadori. We shall do all we can.
<string>To think we would make it this far<lf>without losing a single member of the<lf>Order—Dame Fiorayne among them.
<string>Putting an end to Malzeno is a goal we<lf>all share. Now that our ambition lies just<lf>ahead of us...I am beyond words.
<string>Ah, but no. Such talk must be reserved<lf>for after our safe return.
<string>The mission shall commence once your<lf>preparations are in order. All of us look<lf>forward to your future commendations!
<string>A valiant effort, as expected! With this,<lf>you have successfully eliminated a<lf>tremendous threat to our beloved Kingdom.
<string>Thank you, truly, thank you. Ah, you may<lf>feel Admiral Galleus's expression of such<lf>gratitude lacking, but please understand.
<string>Men of his position must be inscrutable<lf>at all times. The trust and recognition<lf>he feels toward you are undeniable.
<string>Believe me, I know what I'm talking<lf>about. I don't mean to brag, but I'm<lf>sort of an expert at reading the Admiral.
<string>Were only Bahari's misgivings so flimsy...<lf>Unfortunately I don't think we'll be so<lf>lucky in that regard.
<string>The truth of the matter isn't clear yet,<lf>but we will accompany you as always,<lf>regardless.
<string>My lack of reservations about all this<lf>is thanks to you being with us.<lf>Thank you, <PL>.
<string>The same place again? If I had to put<lf>such circumstances into a single word,<lf>I believe "disturbing" would fit the bill.
<string>Even more so with Doctor Tadori himself<lf>heading to the site.
<string>I must be prepared for anything...<lf>I would suggest you do the same.
<string>Now, of all times, I want to call you<lf>by the moniker they used to speak of<lf>you: "<PL>, the Fierce."
<string>The opponent that awaits us is a monster<lf>like the Devil incarnate.
<string>Still, not a single soul in this outpost<lf>fears what is to come.
<string>This, too, is one of the many<lf>significant accomplishments you've<lf>wrought in your tenure here.
<string>We shall not lose. We shall subdue the<lf>terror that has descended upon our<lf>Kingdom! Sally forth, o flame of Kamura!
<string>Defeating the Archdemon, as well as<lf>the Qurio. Your deeds have saved more<lf>than simply my homeland.
<string>Had you failed in your task, the neighboring<lf>countries would have been swallowed up in<lf>this—Kamura among them.
<string>Perish the thought... To say that our here<lf>and now wouldn't exist without you is no<lf>exaggeration. Thank you, the Fierce!
<string>I'd like this investigation to give those<lf>neophytes Luchika and Jae some<lf>valuable experience.
<string>Meeting a hunter like you, unaffiliated<lf>with the Order, would be of particular<lf>benefit to them.
<string>In that sense, I am quite pleased to<lf>have your cooperation, <PL><lf>the Fierce!
<string>Looking out for young knights, fostering<lf>their spontaneous growth, all while<lf>answering my superiors' expectations...
<string>It isn't easy, yet this duty gives my days<lf>purpose. "I'm between a rock and a hard<lf>place," you say? Ha, surely you jest!
<string>For our investigations to go this smoothly<lf>is thanks to everyone's endeavors.<lf>That includes you, Hunter.
<string>And yet, one pillar of emotional support<lf>keeps us on an even keel. That's right...
<string>I speak of Princess Chichae's devotion<lf>on display! Standing all day as she does<lf>would be a mean feat, even for myself!
<string>So elegant...so splendid—! *s-sniff* Ah,<lf>my apologies. I believe something got in<lf>my eye...
<string>Given how infrequently we get hunters<lf>like you around here, I'd like to pick<lf>your brain about something.
<string>What do you think of the Order's conduct?<lf>Jae and Luchika, specifically.
<string>Those two have yet to cut their teeth,<lf>but their inclusion in the research team<lf>is proof of their capacity and character.
<string>I want them to polish such chivalrous<lf>qualities even further. I would love to<lf>hear your opinions in regard to that.
<string>I thought I had grasped the concept,<lf>but undertaking investigations with<lf>you really drove it home.
<string>We may be of different heritage and<lf>standing, yet both of us throw ourselves<lf>bodily at these monsters all the same.
<string>Hunters truly are amazing. Your lot are<lf>consistently respectful and cooperative,<lf>regardless of lineage.
<string>You've been a daily source of stimulation<lf>for Luchika and Jae; your technique, as<lf>well as your proud hunter spirit.
<string>Those two are blessed, to be sure. I<lf>wish I had met a dyed-in-the-wool hunter<lf>such as yourself in my younger days.
<string>Ah, but no. Being where I am now has<lf>granted me the opportunity to raise young<lf>knights. Nothing brings me greater joy.
<string>As dire as the situation was, I have fond<lf>memories of how we banded together<lf>and rose up against the Archdemon!
<string>And we shall do so again, <PL>!<lf>You have the Kingdom's might behind you!<lf>No mercy for the Demonlord!
<string>Well done, well done! Both you and Fiorayne<lf>are the pride of the Kingdom!
<string>Thanks to your presence, all of our new<lf>recruits are showing tremendous promise.<lf>Glory to the Kingdom...and to you, as well!
