<string>Awesome! See how you<lf>swapped scrolls?
<string>When you draw you weapon, you'll see<lf>your Switch Skill loadout at the bottom.
<string>If you press <ICON PAD_B> after a Switch Skill<lf>Swap, you'll perform a Swap Evade!
<string>You can even evade towards<lf>monsters. Pretty gnarly, huh?
<string>Now then, let me tell you how<lf>to set your Switch Skills!
<string>Let me know when you've<lf>had enough practice!
<string>My Cohoot's out lookin' for Tadori,<lf>but so far, nothing!
<string>He's bound to turn up!<lf>Focus on the quest for now.
<string>We finally got a bead on Tadori! I'll tell<lf>you where he is, so swing on over!
<string>Use <OPT ZL>+<ICON PAD_X>+<ICON PAD_A> to perform<lf>a Switch Skill Swap! Try it out!
<string>Use <OPT Gunner_RT>+<ICON PAD_X>+<ICON PAD_A> to perform<lf>a Switch Skill Swap! Try it out!
<string>You got it? Lemme know<lf>if you need more time.
<string>Are you all ready? Just come<lf>talk to me when you're done!
<string>Practice time! Swap to<lf>your heart's content!
<string>Select <COL RED>Complete Quest</COL> from<lf>the Start Menu to head back!
<string>Use Switch Skill Swap to<lf>handle any situation!
<string>Come back any time you<lf>want to practice!
<string>Open your map and use fast<lf>travel to come back up!
<string>Dragonator!<lf>Reload number three!
<string>Preparing fire support. Ready<lf>to unleash hell on your signal!
<string>Can you hear me!? The ballistae<lf>aren't ready yet! Hold on!
<string>That's a Ruby Wirebug! It'll give<lf>your Mounted Punisher a boost.
<string>Alright, Ace!<lf>Try a Mounted Punisher!
<string>Gold Wirebugs lead to more<lf>drops when Wyvern Riding.
<string>Alright, Ace!<lf>Go grab those extra drops!
<string>Wirebugs are a little tricky. You<lf>can only use or the other, OK?
<string>Use the Marionette Spider's thread<lf>to pull a monster in your direction!
<string>First step is to throw<lf>the li'l guy at a monster.
<string>Nice!<lf>The spider's attached!
<string>Now just give that thread a tug<lf>and down the monster goes!
<string>Starburst Bugs absorb elemental<lf>properties from attacks.
<string>Inflict an elemental blight when<lf>you launch a monster at 'em!
<string>We've got a problem! The<lf>ballistae aren't ready yet!
