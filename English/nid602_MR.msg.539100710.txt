<string>C'mon by sometime!
<string><NOFAC>Well, hey there! It's <PL>, right?<lf>Like I wouldn't know who you are! I know<lf>Kamura forgin' when I see it.
<string>Rondine introduced me to Master Hamon<lf>and I got to watch him at the anvil.<lf>It was legendary!
<string>I knew I had to learn everything I could, so<lf>I told him, I ain't leaving 'til you teach<lf>me everything you know!
<string>I've been obsessed with smithin' for as<lf>long as I can remember. I've traveled all<lf>over the world and learned so many things!
<string>You see this here outfit? I based it off the<lf>one worn by a great Smithy I once met.<lf>Really comfy and easy to work in—
<string>Oh, sorry! I'm Minayle. I've recently set<lf>up shop here in the Kingdom and now<lf>I run this here Smithy in Elgado.
<string>And since you're here, how about<lf>we take that gear of yours and do it<lf>up a little?
<string>We can start by upgradin' your weapons to<lf><COL RED>Master Rank</COL>. You'll lose all your Rampage<lf>Skills, but...
<string>You can have me forge ya some <COL RED>Rampage<lf>Decorations</COL> and you can get 'em back!<lf>All ya gotta do is slot 'em in!
<string>Some skills may weaken effects, but you<lf>can try out all sorts of new combinations!<lf>Find out what works best, you know?

<string><VO:SIL>So I hear Kamura is in danger AGAIN?<lf>And it's even worse this time?
<string><VO:NOR>Well, I'm sure it'll be fine if you're on<lf>the job. As for me, I'll be here bangin'<lf>things out just like I always do!
<string>I'd lend Kamura my hammer but I'm sure Hamon's<lf>got it covered. I'd just be in the way anyway!<lf>Ha! Well, let me know if ya need anything!
<string>Whatever you need, I can bang it out!<lf>Just ask! I can even Ramp-Up your<lf>equipment if you need me to!
<string>No need to worry about my skills.<lf>You'll see plenty of Master Hamon<lf>flair in my work!
<string>So how's the research goin'?<lf>You know, if you discover any new<lf>materials, I'd love to see 'em.
<string>I should be able to tell you right away<lf>what they might be useful for.
<string>Hehe, you can trust my judgment, believe me.<lf>I might not look it, but I've been swingin'<lf>this here hammer for quite a while now!
<string>If you've got any scrap, you could take<lf>it next door to the Buddy Smithy.
<string>Those Felynes, Bis and Cotta, are somethin'<lf>else. It's hard not to be impressed by their<lf>teamwork. I'm a little jealous, to be honest.
<string>Don't get me wrong, I don't mind sweatin'<lf>over this anvil by myself, but it's nice to<lf>have an extra hand...or paw sometimes!

<string>So, Bahari's back, huh? Oh, boy...<lf>Here comes those crazy ideas of his.<lf>I mean, it's fine by me.
<string>I'll bang out anything you ask for. The<lf>crazier the better. But Bahari's requests<lf>were a little...much for my predecessor.
<string>So he went off to work in the capital and<lf>now I'm here. Not sure how lucky I am,<lf>but I'm glad to be here.
<string>Either way, the point is, <PL>,<lf>you should look out for Bahari and his<lf>crazy ideas.
<string>So you caught some of those Qurio, huh?<lf>I see! That's why Bahari was all excited<lf>about bein' up to his elbows in "goo."
<string>I swear, I worry about that guy sometimes...<lf>And you, too, <PL>. Be careful<lf>out there.
<string>Hey there, <PL>.<lf>Sounds like your investigations into<lf>the Three Lords are goin' well.
<string>Ever since hearin' about Malzeno, I can't<lf>help but feelin' all excited! Who knows<lf>what we'll learn!?
<string><VO:SER>So, you finally faced the legendary<lf>Malzeno, huh? But not exactly the<lf>way you would've liked...
<string>Don't worry, though. It's gonna be OK,<lf>right? I mean, Fiorayne, she's one<lf>tough gal!
<string>Obviously, I don't have any medical<lf>experience or knowledge, but I'm still<lf>thinkin' what I can do to help.
<string>And basically, it's this.
<string>Just doin' what I do here; givin' you the<lf>support you need. And me and this here<lf>hammer won't let you down!
<string>Hey, <PL>. Is the medicine<lf>craftin' underway now that all the<lf>ingredients have been collected?
<string>...Whew, thank goodness, huh?<lf>I don't remember the last time I felt<lf>this relieved!
<string>It's been hard to relax, you know? But<lf>now I can get back to bangin' stuff out!<lf>Thanks, <PL>!
<string>Y'know, I've seen a lot of hunters over<lf>the years. And I can tell...
<string>Every now and then someone comes<lf>along who can spark somethin' big.<lf>Really big.
<string>And when I look at you, <PL>,<lf>that's exactly what I see. And I'm not<lf>just sayin' that!
<string>I knew you could do it, <PL>!<lf>Maximum respect to ya!
<string>Seriously, I couldn't be happier if I'd done<lf>it myself! It makes the move to Elgado<lf>so much more worthwhile!
<string>Hmmm... What should I do?
<string>Ah, sorry. Don't mind me. I was just<lf>mulling something over for the ship<lf>we're buildin' for the final battle...
<string>If we arm it to the teeth, the ship's gonna<lf>be too slow. *sigh* I'm gonna be rackin'<lf>my brain about this all day...
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> nid602_base5_005
<string>You headin' out soon, <PL>?<lf>Lemme know if you need anything. You<lf>can go straight to the front of the line.
<string>It's totally fine. I mean, I don't have<lf>any other work that's more important<lf>right now.
<string>The only orders I have at the moment are<lf>from those lame-brain Hell Hunters sittin'<lf>over there...
<string>I've had my fair share of adventures, but<lf>goin' up against some kind of fairy-tale<lf>monster!? Never in my wildest dreams!
<string>Ya never know what life's gonna throw<lf>at you, right, <PL>?
<string>...Exactly! And I bet there'll be more<lf>surprises to come, too.
<string>Kamura's smithin' really took my breath away.<lf>I mean, I've learned all kinds of techniques,<lf>but I'm just an amateur in comparison!
<string>Master Hamon was, well, a shock!<lf>The precision! It's just unbelievable!<lf>Watchin' him work is like art.
<string>If I can spare the time, I've gotta get over<lf>there more and see if I can't squeeze<lf>a few more secrets out of him!
<string>Pretty much everyone here is from the<lf>Kingdom, except me. I got picked up<lf>by some big wig from the Kingdom.
<string>But I'm glad I chose the research team<lf>over some big, fancy workshop in the<lf>capital.
<string>If we're bein' honest here, I'm hopin' to get<lf>my mitts on some Malzeno materials. Just<lf>imagine bangin' out some gear with that!
<string>Apparently Master Hamon was once<lf>a skilled hunter, so he's got a different<lf>perspective from most other smithies.
<string>And sure, that's an experience I'll<lf>never have, but if it's about technique,<lf>there's no reason I can't learn.
<string>So my aim is to travel as far and wide<lf>as possible and soak up as much<lf>different forgin' knowledge as I can.
<string>...Huh? Why? Because I plan on bein'<lf>the best Smithy in the world, of course!
<string>Oh! Hey there, <PL>! Sorry<lf>'bout that, I was concentratin' on my<lf>tools.
<string>See this hammer? For a Smithy like<lf>me, this thing is my life.
<string>I can't be the world's greatest Smithy if I<lf>don't have great tools to bang stuff out with!<lf>As a hunter, I'm sure you can understand!
<string>This hammer's not quite there yet. Just<lf>needs a little more refinement!
<string>Most Smithies live and work in one<lf>place their whole lives. And they're<lf>pretty particular about their workshops.
<string>But I'm the total opposite of that.<lf>I've always traveled and I'm good to work<lf>anywhere.
<string>This place is basically exactly how the<lf>last Smithy left it. Fine by me. All I need<lf>is my hammer and something to bang out!
<string>So, <PL>.<lf>Been back to Kamura lately?
<string>Nothin' like bein' home, right? I tell ya,<lf>it's been ages for me. Maybe it's time<lf>for a visit.
<string>Might be good to see the place that set<lf>me on this path. And, you know, visit<lf>family and stuff.
<string>Hey, <PL>!<lf>Good job takin' down that Amatsu!
<string>I really love Kamura Village, ya know?<lf>I gotta admit there was a part of me that<lf>was kinda worried things might go wrong.
<string>It's been way too long since I last visited<lf>and talked to Hamon. Gotta show him<lf>how much my biceps have grown, eh?
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>C'mon by sometime!
<string><NOFAC><PL>! Master Hamon gave<lf>me a few pointers that'll let me forge<lf><COLS RED>Level 4</COL> decorations for you!
<string>There's some pretty sweet ones that are<lf>sure to give ya a leg up in your hunts! Drop<lf>by anytime and I'll bang 'em out for ya!
<string>C'mon by sometime!
<string><NOFAC><PL>! Master Hamon gave<lf>me a few pointers that'll let me forge<lf>even more decorations for you!
<string>Take your pick, and get that gear of<lf>yours in order!
<string>C'mon by sometime!
<string><NOFAC><PL>! Master Hamon gave<lf>me a few pointers that'll let me forge<lf>even more decorations for you!

<string>Take your pick, and get that gear of<lf>yours in order!
<string>C'mon by sometime!
<string><NOFAC>Good news, <PL>!<lf>I've got some new Kinsects on sale for you!
<string>Have a look at 'em and see if anything<lf>catches your fancy!
<string>This should be fun!
<string><NOFAC>We-heh-hell, <PL>! Took<lf>out an afflicted monster, did ya? Could you<lf>show me some of the materials you got?
<string>Now this is mighty interestin'! Completely<lf>different from the regular stuff I'm used to.
<string>If you find enough of it, I think I can make<lf>your gear even better, maybe even make<lf>some new decorations too!
<string><NOTE:428>If you find any more, bring 'em to me,<lf>and I'll bang ya out something real good,<lf>OK?
<string>C'mon by sometime!
<string><NOFAC>How ya doin', <PL>! I can<lf>forge a bunch more layered armor for ya<lf>now!
<string>Don't forget you can even try 'em on<lf>before you make your pick.
<string>So whadda ya think? What kind of fashion<lf>ya aiming for this time around?
<string>C'mon by sometime!
<string><NOFAC>Ah, there you are, <PL>!<lf>I just found out that Qurious Crafting has<lf>a lot more potential for weapons!
<string>By adding more Anomaly Slots, you can draw<lf>even more strength out of your weapon!
<string>I already prepped the weapons you augmented,<lf>so be sure to have a look!
<string>This should be fun!
<string><NOFAC>Hey there, <PL>! You're gonna love<lf>this! I've finally found a way to put all those<lf>materials from afflicted monsters to good use!
<string>I call it <COLS RED>Qurious Crafting</COL>! And with this<lf>new forgin' technique, I can enhance your<lf>gear like never before! Excitin' stuff!
<string>I was reluctant at first, since the materials<lf>come from the Qurio, but Master Hamon<lf>told me...
<string>"We must take advantage of each and every<lf>option available to us in order to overcome<lf>our current situation." Which got me thinking...
<string>If Kamura can harness the power of the<lf>Rampage, we can do something similar!
<string>So, let's get this show on the road!<lf>It's time to put this Qurious Crafting<lf>to the test!
<string>I'm lookin' forward to this!
<string><NOFAC>Hey there, <PL>! You're gonna love<lf>this! I've finally found a way to put all those<lf>materials from afflicted monsters to good use!

<string>So, let's get this show on the road!<lf>It's time to put this Qurious Crafting<lf>to the test!
<string>Got some news for ya!
<string><NOFAC>Hey there, <PL>! You're gonna<lf>love this! You know how Nakago over in<lf>Kamura came up with layered armor, right?
<string>Well, that got me thinkin'...<lf>What if you could layer your weapons, too?
<string>I know you hunters are all about your<lf>fashion. Gotta complete the look, right?<lf>Hahaha! Well, now you can!
<string>Here, have a ticket on me so you can give<lf>it a try! I know you want to! Come by any-<lf>time and I'll bang somethin' out for ya!
<string>This is gonna be good!
<string>Hey there, <PL>!<lf>I'm takin' it Bahari told you I got somethin'<lf>for ya, huh? Well, he's right!
<string>So Bahari was goin' on about his new Anomaly<lf>discovery and suddenly *BOOM* it hit me like<lf>a hammer upside my noggin'!
<string>I thought, "I should make a decoration<lf>to help y'all fight against Bloodblight."<lf>And so I did! I call it the <COLS RED>Bloody Jewel</COL>!
<string>Slot that bad boy in and it'll help reduce<lf>the effects of Bloodblight! Good stuff, right!?
<string>I added it to the list of Rampage Decorations,<lf>so make sure to check it out! And just holler<lf>if you want me to bang one out for ya!
<string>I'm itchin' to get to work!
<string>Get this, <PL>!<lf>I've come up with some <COLS RED>new ways to<lf>amp up your gear</COL> with Qurious Crafting!
<string>That Bahari really put my feet to the fire.<lf>Thanks to him, I was able to come up with<lf>a new way to use Afflicted Materials.
<string>What're ya waitin' for, an invitation!?<lf>Come on! Let's bang somethin' out!
<string>I'm itchin' to get to work!
<string>Get this, <PL>!<lf>I've come up with some <COLS RED>new ways to<lf>amp up your gear</COL> with Qurious Crafting!
<string>I've been bangin' my head against the<lf>wall tryin' to think of way to help out<lf>with y'all's research, and WHAM!
<string>It suddenly hit me! Skill augments!<lf>Yeah? YEAH!? The results ain't too stable,<lf>but definitely worth a try!
<string>Well, what're ya waiting for!?<lf>Let's bang somethin' out!
<string>Again, good job on takin' that monster down!
<string><NOFAC>Hey, <PL>!<lf>Heard you gave that Velkhana the whoopin'<lf>of a lifetime! Awesome job!
<string>I've been lookin' into ways of usin' Velkhana<lf>materials recently and I actually hit on<lf>somethin' really interestin'!
<string>Turns out, if you equip a weapon made of<lf>these materials together with Velkhana armor,<lf>it becomes extra powerful!
<string>Should prove handy out in the field, methinks!<lf>Why not give it a whirl?
<string>Another job well done!
<string><NOFAC>Way to go, <PL>! I bet that<lf>Amatsu didn't even know what hit it!<lf>So, got any interestin' materials for me?
<string>Well, helloooooo...<lf>I think I might just be able to use this<lf>for that thing Hamon mentioned!
<string>He taught me a way of imbuing weapons<lf>with some kind of special powers.
<string>Should prove really useful!<lf>Give it a try, if you're feelin' up for it!
<string>C'mon by sometime!
<string><NOFAC><PL>! I can forge a bunch<lf>more Rampage Decorations for ya now!
<string>Take your pick, and get that gear of<lf>yours in order!
