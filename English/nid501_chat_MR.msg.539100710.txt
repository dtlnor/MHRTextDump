<string>Malzeno's appearance has<lf>changed? Be on high alert!
<string>Parts of its body are glowing red...<lf>Let's attack and observe.
<string>That's it! It's working!<lf>Maintain the attack!
<string>Success! My hunch was correct.<lf>Let's finish this now!
<string>This doesn't look good.<lf>Powerful attack incoming!
<string>We're not hitting hard enough!<lf>Aim for the glowing red parts!
<string>Wait! Don't get too close now.<lf>Pull back and recover first!
<string>I don't like this. It's about to—<lf>Pull back at once!
<string>It's drawing us in!<lf>Take cover behind the rocks!
<string>Pull the lever to call<lf>in fire support!
<string>Fire support's ready!<lf>Signal the Admiral!
<string>It's gone over the cliff!<lf>Let's follow it down!
<string>Ballista supplies incoming!<lf>Head towards the drop point!
<string>It's heading towards those Qurio!<lf>Use the ballistae to attack!
<string>Attack incoming!<lf>Get out of there!
<string>Success! It's wide open!<lf>Let us not waste this opportunity!
<string>So much for that... We'll have to<lf>wait for the next round of supplies.
<string>Some kind of red shard just fell<lf>off its body. What is that!?
<string>A mighty attack! That knocked<lf>off an even bigger fragment!
<string>The fragments exploded?<lf>Let's make it drop more!
<string>It's become even more devilish!<lf>Watch out for new attacks!
<string>Aim for the Qurio on its back!
<string>Qurio incoming!<lf>Use the ballistae to intercept!
<string>It's set ablaze!<lf>It truly is a demon!
<string>On my honor, I will end you!<lf>Attack!
<string>On my honor as a knight,<lf>we will achieve our goal!
<string>I won't let Kamura down...<lf>That's my promise as a knight!
<string>There's the Blood Orange Bishaten!<lf>Let us put an end to this!
<string>Let's be careful. I'd rather not<lf>get an earful from Admiral Galleus.
<string>First time seeing one of these.<lf>Where's it off to!?
<string>Why would it appear in the Ruins?<lf>Because of the Kingdom monsters...?
<string>Don't let your guard down!
<string>Excellent work! We'll protect<lf>Kamura together!
<string>Finally, one of the Three Lords!<lf>This is sure to be a royal pain!
<string>I have an awful feeling about this...<lf>That Garangolm must be close!
<string>I thought Garangolm were docile!<lf>Why would it act this way!?
<string>By hunting it, maybe we can learn<lf>more about the Kingdom monsters!
<string>Bahari is hiding and observing us.<lf>Ever the researcher, isn't he?
<string>There's no telling what a monster<lf>of that size is capable of...
<string>Unimaginable fury... Who could've<lf>seen this coming!?
<string>There's so much to investigate!<lf>Let's hurry up and finish this!
<string>Let us finish what we started<lf>in the Shrine Ruins...
<string>Our target is surrounded by<lf>mystery. We need to stay alert.
<string>The target has been spotted!<lf>You won't escape this time!
<string>We should be careful, it'll be<lf>much more aggressive this time!
<string>The wind has shifted directions.<lf>This can't be good. Let us hurry!
<string>Many a knight has been injured<lf>by this beast. This ends here!
<string>It's gone howling mad!<lf>We need to be careful!
<string>With you by my side,<lf>we can accomplish anything!
<string>Now we will strike back!<lf>This time victory is ours.
<string>With the two of us together,<lf>there truly is nothing to fear.
<string>Long time no see, Malzeno! On my<lf>honor as a knight, I will end you!
<string>We will prevail!<lf>Hold nothing back!
<string>A worthy adversary indeed!
<string>Let us sever this ill-fated connection<lf>between Malzeno and the Kingdom!
<string>Vile creature!<lf>We will show you no mercy!
<string>This ends here! We must bring peace<lf>back to Kamura and the Kingdom!
<string>Farewell Malzeno...<lf>Your reign of terror is over.
<string>Let us shear through this inky sun<lf>and bring light to the Kingdom!
<string>Demons belong only in fairy tales!<lf>Crawl back to your dark slumber!
<string>Relying on Qurio?<lf>What a pathetic creature!
<string>Good to see everyone has our backs!<lf>We owe it to them to return alive!
<string>Archdemon of the Abyss... You don't<lf>belong under the sun's rays!
<string>There is no place in our Kingdom<lf>for a devil's darkness!
<string>The clouds will part, the stars will<lf>shine. Everlasting shadow begone!
<string>What an inspiration to witness<lf>your fierce fighting spirit!
<string>The sun will shine and show the way.<lf>You've proven yourself a true hero.
<string>I don't believe it!<lf>The Qurio's influence! Here!?
<string>I have a bad feeling about this...<lf>Quickly, let us find that Lunagaron!
<string>There it is!<lf>...But something's not right.
<string>The Qurio have it under<lf>their control. Stay sharp...
<string>The situation is graver<lf>than I had imagined.
<string>We must return to report.
<string>We must not let it get away!<lf>We need to vanquish it!
<string>I do not sense any life here...<lf>What is going on!?
