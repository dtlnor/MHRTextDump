<string>I've been waiting for you.
<string>Humble greetings...<lf>Luchika, knight of the Royal Order<lf>at your service.
<string>You are the "Fierce Flame of Kamura,"<lf>are you not? Tales of your deeds have<lf>reached far. Welcome to Elgado.
<string>As Galleus and Fiorayne have suggested,<lf>it may help you settle in if you become more<lf>familiar with your new surroundings.
<string>I shall share a small tip to assist you in<lf>doing so. A rare family of Snowy Cohoots<lf>have made their nest here...
<string>If you haven't seen them yet, OH MY GOG<lf>they are soooooo adorable, I just wanna—<lf>*ahem* I encourage you to seek them out.
<string>Doing so may help you to learn the layout<lf>of Elgado. Ah, one more thing. I have this<lf>for you...
<string>The official uniform worn by the Cohoots<lf>of the Kingdom. I hope you'll let your<lf>own feathered friend try it on for size.

<string>I humbly require your assistance.
<string>Humble greetings, <PL>.<lf>If you are able to spare some time, I was<lf>wondering if perhaps you can assist me.
<string>In addition to our normal duties, we knights<lf>of the Order are encouraged to further our<lf>training by taking on hunting quests.
<string>There is a particular quest that is well suited<lf>to my training, but it requires that someone<lf>accompany me. My colleagues have all refused...
<string>Hm? Why have they refused? This I do not<lf>know. Perhaps they are intimidated by<lf>my hunting prowess. Nevertheless....
<string>Forgive me for having just met and asking<lf>a personal favor, but perhaps you would<lf>be interested in joining me?
<string>I am in your debt.
<string>You have my deepest gratitude. Not only<lf>for your time but for such an exhilarating<lf>hunt. It has been too long...
<string>Perhaps there is nothing more thrilling<lf>than standing before a beast that can<lf>easily part you of your head.
<string>Forgive me, but I do hope I may count<lf>on your assistance if another suitable<lf>quest becomes available.
<string>I humbly require your assistance.
<string>Humble greetings, <PL>.<lf>I could use your assistance again,<lf>if you can spare the time.
<string>When my colleagues heard of us hunting<lf>together, they pushed me, rather strongly,<lf>to continue my training with you. Odd...
<string>Perhaps it is because of your exemplary<lf>hunting abilities. Yes, yes. I do have<lf>much to learn from you.
<string>If you would be so kind to once again assist<lf>in my training, I would be eternally grateful.
<string>I am in your debt.
<string>You have my deepest gratitude.<lf>Hunting with you has been most<lf>advantageous to my training.
<string>That was a rather vicious adversary. It is lucky<lf>that our gear endured such attacks. Had it not,<lf>surely we would have been mauled severely.
<string>I shall take my equipment to the Smithy at once.<lf>One must never overlook maintenance. Even the<lf>slightest imperfection can have dire consequences.
<string>Perhaps it is time for an upgrade. Thinking<lf>about what to use out on a hunt is almost<lf>as thrilling as the hunt itself, is it not?
<string>When you have completed repairs on your<lf>equipment, I do hope that we may continue<lf>my training.
<string>I humbly require your assistance.
<string>Humble greetings, <PL>.<lf>I could use your assistance again,<lf>if you can spare the time.
<string>I have selected a quest that possesses a great<lf>degree of difficulty—Yes? Do I remember how<lf>I conducted myself during the last quest?
<string>Of course, I do. I've heard the name my colleagues<lf>have given me. "Luchika the Lunatic..." *sigh*<lf>I'm not a loon... I'm just passionate about hunting.
<string>If one does not fully immerse themselves in<lf>that which they love, what point is there to<lf>even doing it? Surely you can understand that.
<string>I apologize if my behavior out in the field<lf>is a little...much, but I hope it doesn't<lf>dissuade you from assisting me further.
<string>I am in your debt.
<string>You have my deepest gratitude. I have<lf>been immensely pleased to hunt with you.
<string>I feared that my training would suffer as I was<lf>not able to find someone to hunt with. But<lf>thanks to you, my fears have been allayed.
<string>I must admit I am not well experienced<lf>at revealing my softer side, but I do wish<lf>to express my deepest gratitude.
<string>Your kindness will not be forgotten. If perhaps<lf>you have time to hunt together in the future,<lf>do not hesitate to call on me.
<string>May I have a word with you?
<string>The Order is always researching weaponry<lf>and currently our attention has been drawn<lf>to archery, and in particular, arrows.
<string>Arrows need to be strong, but also offer<lf>sufficient flexibility. That's asking quite<lf>a lot from any material.
<string>In the course of discussions, I've noted<lf>that Seregios Bladescales may be the<lf>key to success.
<string>Forgive me, but might I ask you to<lf>capture a Seregios?
<string>I am most grateful!
<string>Studying the scales of a captured Seregios<lf>will most certainly lead to the development<lf>of strong but supple arrows. Thank you.
<string>As a reward, I have shared the details of how<lf>to upgrade the Felyne Bow with the Smithy.<lf>Please have a look when you are able.

<string>I've been waiting for you. I am Luchika,<lf>knight of the Royal Order, at your service.
<string>You are the "Fierce Flame of Kamura,"<lf>are you not? Tales of your deeds have<lf>reached far.
<string>Like you, I am a hunter. I look forward<lf>to seeing your skill in battle someday.
<string>Elgado is but an observation base, but<lf>it has outfitted with all the necessary<lf>facilities for our duties.
<string>We are blessed with many professionals<lf>and artisans. We can thank Admiral<lf>Galleus for assembling them all here.
<string>If you find yourself in need of answers,<lf>I shall lend you my ear.
<string>Here in Elgado, hunters are also referred<lf>to as "knights." Those sworn to protect<lf>the Kingdom.
<string>A suitable name, one that gives a sense<lf>of responsibility and fulfillment to those<lf>who'll carry it.
<string>We are knights of the Royal Order because<lf>we fight to protect the Kingdom, not only<lf>for our own selfish ends.
<string>Elgado lacks any kind of arena, but<lf>we make up for it with advice and<lf>training from real professionals.
<string>The Admiral, Master Arlow, Dame Fiorayne,<lf>and you of course. It would be an honor to<lf>hear any feedback you may have.
<string>Our ultimate goal here is to defeat<lf>Malzeno. We must also halt the<lf>advance of the Kingdom monsters.
<string>Questing is an important aspect in our<lf>daily lives, yet dare I say investigating<lf>can be just as important.
<string>I had hoped Jae would take his studies<lf>more seriously... At this rate, he'll be<lf>all brawn and no brains.
<string>It isn't like Fiorayne to be reckless.<lf>It isn't like Admiral Galleus to be<lf>short-tempered, either.
<string>I must admit, Fiorayne's sense of duty<lf>and passion for her work often makes<lf>me worry about her terribly...
<string>I know she means well, I only hope that<lf>she takes better care of herself...
<string>The people of Elgado have been<lf>officially notified of the urgent need<lf>to investigate the Kingdom's monsters.
<string>This is, of course, all thanks to you<lf>and your efforts, <PL>.<lf>I am in your debt.
<string>We too shall play an active role in the<lf>investigation, as well as during the hunts.<lf>Let us keep our sights on our targets!
<string><PL>, we have just received<lf>new orders from Admiral Galleus.
<string>We are to begin the hunt for the Garangolm.<lf>At last, it's time to confront the first of<lf>the Three Lords!
<string>Bahari went to scout ahead. I'm sure he'll<lf>be fine, but do please look out for him.
<string>I am relieved to hear Bahari has returned<lf>unharmed. You have our gratitude.
<string>Going forward, we can expect more ferocious<lf>monsters, perhaps even rivaling the Three<lf>Lords, to make an appearance.
<string>I will continue to devote all my time and<lf>energy to this project, and endeavor to<lf>fulfill my duties as a knight of the Order.
<string>So it's true then, a new species of monster<lf>has been secured? That's rather valuable<lf>for us academics.
<string>Although I don't share Bahari's enthusiasm<lf>for these kinds of things, I'd be lying if<lf>I said I wasn't interested.
<string>Nature is truly terrifying sometimes, but,<lf>then again, this is for research purposes.<lf>I...I will be fine... *cringe*
<string>So Malzeno has finally made its move.<lf>I was relieved to hear Fiorayne only<lf>sustained minor injuries.
<string>Yet, despite the entire Kingdom pursuing<lf>Malzeno for years, a lot of its information<lf>is still largely unknown to us.
<string>At this stage we are unsure where this<lf>will lead us, so please, tread carefully,<lf><PL>.
<string><VO:SER>I've always been able to put my duties<lf>before my personal feelings, but I must admit<lf>the situation has been difficult to digest.
<string>I'm trying not to let it affect me, but I'm<lf>afraid I cannot stop shaking. I MUST<lf>become stronger!
<string>I'll let the doctor do his work, I will attend<lf>to Fiorayne's duties until she recovers.
<string>In times like these, we must keep a level<lf>head and maintain our sights on our target.
<string>Espinas? One must be a very skilled<lf>doctor indeed to know such a recipe<lf>that requires deadly poisons.
<string>Even with all my years of study, I've yet<lf>to learn of any such method. I must<lf>study harder!
<string>*sigh* It's much too quiet around here<lf>without Fiorayne. I hope she recovers<lf>soon...
<string>The time has come to confront Malzeno!
<string>On my honor as a knight of the Royal<lf>Order, Malzeno will meet its demise!
<string>And now that Fiorayne has recovered,<lf>our preparations are complete. The Order<lf>is ready and waiting. For the Kingdom!
<string><PL>, as a knight of Royal<lf>Order, you have my thanks for vanquishing<lf>the abhorrent Malzeno.
<string>Admiral Galleus yet appears cautious.<lf>I would expect no less from him.
<string>We shall remain vigilant, and continue<lf>to strive to vanquish this threat to the<lf>Kingdom.
<string>Who could have anticipated that the Qurio<lf>were capable of such a thing?
<string>I now understand why Admiral Galleus<lf>acted as he did. He must have sensed<lf>this situation coming.
<string>If these clouds are a sign of things to come,<lf>we must remain vigilant. <PL>,<lf>keep your sights on your target!
<string>I've studied a lot of things throughout my<lf>life, but I never thought I'd ever be asked<lf>to study a monster from a children's story.
<string>Admiral Galleus has readied his ship<lf>for battle. We shall use it as our base<lf>of operations.
<string>The final battle is here, <PL>.<lf>Let us put an end to this with the combined<lf>power of Elgado and the Order!
<string>If I may ask one thing of you. Do look<lf>after yourself out there. After all, I'd like<lf>to continue my training with you.
<string>Good day to you, <PL>. With<lf>the Archdemon of the Abyss vanquished,<lf>Elgado appears to be in high spirits.
<string>However, the threat to the Kingdom has<lf>not yet been fully eliminated. I pray that<lf>you remain in Elgado a little longer...
<string>If you find yourself with time on your<lf>hands, I hope that perhaps we may<lf>go out questing together.
<string>Do you have a moment, <PL>?<lf>I was wondering if you could tell me more<lf>about Kamura.
<string>I heard that the way they do things over<lf>there vastly differs from how we go<lf>about doing things here...
<string>...I see, it appears our homes differ in<lf>many respects. I'd like to hear more<lf>about it if you can find some time.
<string>Do you fancy any particular weapon type,<lf><PL>? Perhaps a favorite<lf>weapon?
<string>My current weapon has served me well.<lf>It feels like, the more I care for it, the better<lf>it performs.
<string>I believe an item forms a bond with its<lf>owner, especially if used over a long<lf>period of time and with sincerity.
<string>I have just returned from a quest.<lf>Dare I say, it was quite the challenge.
<string>Others say that I am a different person<lf>out on the hunt... Perhaps too enthusiastic?
<string>Master Arlow assured me it's nothing<lf>to worry about. I hope he's right...
<string>I don't mean to bother you with such things<lf>but, people are saying I become a totally<lf>different person during a quest.
<string>Fiorayne said that as a knight of the<lf>Royal Order, we must follow protocol<lf>and carry ourselves with honor...
<string>But then Master Arlow told me that<lf>I have nothing to worry about, it's just<lf>my way of doing things.
<string>I don't know who to listen to...<lf>What about you? Who do you<lf>think is right?
<string><PL>, may I ask about your<lf>thoughts on Bunny Dango?
<string>Tasty, filling, and colorful... Agreed!<lf>I thought as much.
<string>Hmmm... Talking about dango has<lf>made me hungry...
<string>I apologize for bothering you with such<lf>things, but I think I have found a solution<lf>to my "problem..."
<string>While consulting with Admiral Galleus,<lf>he mentioned that finding a state of<lf>pure concentration is key.
<string>I realized, I was too focused on what others<lf>thought about my behavior and not focusing<lf>on what's most important. A successful hunt.
<string>I have decided to continue enjoying myself.<lf>If others find fault in that, then it is their<lf>loss. I will continue to be me!
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>Caring for your equipment is the most<lf>important thing you can do. You can<lf>never be too careful...
