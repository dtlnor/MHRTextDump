<string>Are you really leaving, <PL>?
<string>Elder Fugen said that you had to go<lf>to work outside of the village?
<string>I don't know anything about the world<lf>outside Kamura. But I bet it's fun and<lf>interesting!
<string>I heard there's a faraway place that<lf>needs your help now. You're so nice<lf>for helping them! But...
<string>I'll, I'll miss you so much!<lf>Well, I wish you lots and lots of luck!<lf>Please come back and visit soon!
<string>OH! <PL>!
<string>It's been a while, huh? I used to see you<lf>every day when you were living here,<lf>so this feels kinda weird.
<string>I mean, I've missed having you around,<lf>but I'm looking forward to all your stories<lf>about the outside world!
<string>There's so much I don't know, I can't<lf>wait to find out about it! One day<lf>I wanna leave the village, too.
<string>I've heard so many stories about Elgado<lf>from Hinoa and Minoto!
<string>When I told the Elder Fugen that I wanted<lf>to go, too, he said, "When you learn to<lf>look after yourself."
<string>So I'm gonna train really, really hard.<lf>And one day, I'll be super strong, just<lf>like Hinoa and Minoto!
<string>Then I'll be able to go visit you<lf>in Elgado, <PL>.<lf>I'll do it, you'll see!
<string>I'd love for more and more people to<lf>try candy apples. People from other<lf>place, too!
<string>The trouble is, they're not like Bunny<lf>Dango. They don't really help out<lf>on the hunt.
<string>Maybe I could try making different types?<lf>That's it! That's what I'm gonna do!
<string>I'm gonna ask Yomogi about it. If I come<lf>up with a new candy apple, you'll try it,<lf>won't you?
<string>You know what Seihaku's mom said to me?<lf>"Thanks for everything."
<string>When I asked her what she meant,<lf>she said it was thanks to me that<lf>Seihaku was working so hard.
<string>But I don't get it... I didn't do anything!
<string><PL>! Are you OK?<lf>You're not hurt, are you?
<string>Wow, really!? I'm so glad! Because I heard<lf>you fought a big scary monster!
<string>How did I know? Because Master Utsushi<lf>told me all about it! Every little detail,<lf>too! He said, "My Ace is a hero!"
<string>You're so nice and cool for helping<lf>everyone in the Kingdom!
<string>But even if you're a big superstar hero<lf>over in the Kingdom, I'm so happy that<lf>you come back and visit me!
<string>Did you meet the nice lady that came<lf>from the Kingdom to be Mister Hamon's<lf>apprentice? I really like her!
<string>She's so pretty. And she really loves<lf>Kamura. She even said she really<lf>liked my candy apples!
<string>She was so nice to me and told me so<lf>many things about people outside of<lf>Kamura.
<string>It was so fun talking to her! I really<lf>hope she comes back to visit. I can't<lf>wait to talk to her again!
<string>Hey, guess what!? Guess what!?<lf>Rondine took some of my candy<lf>apples to Elgado!
<string>And people loved them! Hehe, I'm so happy!
<string>I mean, eating delicious food is great,<lf>but having other people enjoy delicious<lf>food you've made is even greater!
<string>She asked if she could take some more,<lf>too! So now I'm gonna work super hard<lf>to make lots and lots.
<string>Hey, <PL>! Rondine told<lf>me that there's a bunch of Minoto's<lf>pictures in Elgado!
<string>Is it true? I tried to ask Minoto about,<lf>but she wouldn't tell me anything...
<string>I LOVE Minoto's pictures, but she never<lf>shows them to me. She says they're not<lf>that good, but I think they're great!
<string>Hmmm... Maybe if I go to Elgado, I'll get<lf>to see lots of her pictures!
<string>Hey, guess what, <PL>!?<lf>Did you know I'm training to be a hunter?<lf>Shiika's teaching me.
<string>She's the greatest! When she swings<lf>that hammer of hers and it hits the<lf>ground, you can feel the earth shake!
<string>Master Hojo thinks so, too! He's all like,<lf>"Shiika's hammer can smash a monster<lf>flat as a lily pad!"
<string>I'm gonna train really, really hard so<lf>one day I can be as strong as Shiika!
<string>You know, Seihaku's been teasing me.<lf>But when Hinami, the umbrella merchant,<lf>saw, she just said, "Boys, huh?"
<string>Then when I asked her if all boys are like<lf>that, she said her little brother used to be<lf>that way, too.
<string>But she also said boys don't always mean<lf>to be mean. And that she thought Seihaku<lf>would change when he got older.
<string>I don't get it. How can you be so mean if<lf>you don't mean to be mean!? If you don't<lf>even mean it, how can you change?
<string>I'm so confused...<lf>I just don't understand boys at all.
<string>Elder Fugen said that you going to Elgado<lf>has made a lot of new opportunities for<lf>Kamura.
<string>Since you started helping out in Elgado,<lf>Hinoa, Minoto, and Master Utsushi have<lf>all gone there, too.
<string>He said with more people coming and going,<lf>it's easier to leave the village. And maybe<lf>more new people will come, too.
<string>I guess I'm still too young to leave. But<lf>I wanna learn all I can about the outside<lf>world! There must some amazing stories!
<string>So, do you have any interesting stories<lf>about Elgado? Tell me one, please<lf>please, please, pleeeeeeeease!
<string>I heard some super strong dragon appeared<lf>out of nowhere!? Are you gonna go off and<lf>fight it!?
<string>I'm getting kinda scared, to be honest.<lf>Elder Fugen, Hinoa, Kagero... They're all<lf>acting kinda weird...
<string>Nothing scary is gonna happen, right,<lf><PL>? Nothing sad is gonna<lf>happen, right?
<string>Promise me you'll come home safely!
<string>Hey, <PL>! Did you hear!?<lf>Yomogi used to be a princess!
<string>But when I asked her about it she said,<lf>"don't worry I'm still just plain ol' Yomogi<lf>from the Tea Shop."
<string>That makes me happy. Yomogi is Yomogi.<lf>She's not changing, and I like that.
