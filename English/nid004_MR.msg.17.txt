<string>Oh! Hey there, <PL>!<lf>Off to new horizons, huh? Exciting!<lf>It's your first time, right?
<string>I went outside the village once, ya know.<lf>When I was little. At least, that's what<lf>Master Hojo said.
<string>I was like, "What!? When?" and he said,<lf>"Johoho! When you were a little baby!"<lf>But I don't remember it, like, at all!
<string>And he wouldn't tell me anything else<lf>about it! So I guess, in a way, it's like<lf>I've never been, right?
<string>But that means it's gonna be your job<lf>to tell me what it's like out there. I want<lf>tons of stories, OK, <PL>?
<string>Heeeeey, <PL>! Welcome back!<lf>Looks like you're in one piece! You are<lf>in one piece, aren't you? Oh, good!
<string>I was kinda worried at first...<lf>But just a little!
<string>Hinoa was so worried, she started<lf>dual-wielding dango! It was pretty<lf>crazy for a while.
<string>Minoto said that she'd stuff so many<lf>in her mouth that she'd look like<lf>a chipmunk! Hehehe.
<string>It's great for business, sure, but...<lf>I worry about her health!
<string>I've heard so many stories about Elgado<lf>from Hinoa and Minoto.
<string>It sounds like sooo much fun!<lf>I'm starting to think I should visit.<lf>Maybe I should ask if I can go along...
<string>Hmmm... Now that I think about it, maybe<lf>it's not such a good idea. I mean, I'm too<lf>busy here coming up with new flavors...
<string>And the last time I left the Tea Shop<lf>with the Felynes, SOMEONE wrote<lf>"Dando" on the menu...
<string>And it was like that FOR MONTHS<lf>and no one told me... *sigh* Can<lf>you believe that!?
<string>I was just saying how much I wanted to<lf>try one of Azuki's dango, and guess<lf>what? Master Utsushi bought me some!
<string>I shared them with Chef Otemai. They<lf>were amazing! Tasted so...sweet<lf>and bean-y! So Azuki-like!
<string>And it's been sooo long since I tasted<lf>that unique flavor of Azuki's dango.<lf>I'm so proud of her!
<string>It's funny. We all make them the same<lf>way, but all our dango taste different.<lf>I wonder why that is?
<string>A lot's happened while you've been away,<lf>you know, <PL>.
<string>The other day Master Hojo and Utsushi<lf>were— Then Hamon and Mihaba were—<lf>And Iori was, like— And then—
<string>Minoto and Rondine said— And<lf>Elder Fugen and Kagero were all—<lf>And Wakana and Seihaku—
<string>Agh! There's just so much to tell you!<lf>Are you busy? Let me get some dango<lf>and I'll bring you up to speed!
<string>Hey, <PL>!<lf>Welcome back!
<string>I heard all of the amazing stories about<lf>you in Elgado. Master Utsushi told me<lf>everything! Hehehe.
<string>So now you've saved the whole Kingdom<lf>from disaster? Wow, you're not just<lf>a hero anymore. You're a superstar!
<string>You thinking about going anywhere else<lf>after this?
<string>I bet if you do, you'll be a superstar and<lf>everyone'll love you! But don't forget you<lf>were our superstar first, OK!?
<string>Got a funny story for ya! One time Hinoa<lf>said that she wanted to learn how to make<lf>dango.
<string>So me and Otemai showed her, and Hinoa<lf>being Hinoa, picked it up right away. No<lf>trouble at all!
<string>BUT, she ate all the dango she made...<lf>As fast as she cooked 'em, she wolfed<lf>'em down! Every single one of them!
<string>So it didn't take long before all the<lf>ingredients were gone. Then Otemai<lf>banned her from making any more...
<string>I felt bad because, well, she's such a great<lf>customer... But she was gonna eat us out<lf>of house and home if we didn't stop her!
<string>I just love Master Hamon's gadgets!<lf>He told me he often puts little gadgets<lf>and gizmos into his weapons!
<string>I bet my heavy bowgun's got some hidden<lf>features! Like, I bet it goes click, ker-blam,<lf>BOOM...or something!
<string>He said he likes to use every technique<lf>he's ever learned, and trying things out<lf>in unusual ways.
<string>So now I'm thinking I could do the same<lf>for my dango. Use every technique I know<lf>and put some BOOM into my next recipe!
<string>I could add this...with that...and...a little<lf>of this... Make it come out the side like—<lf>OK! I'm gonna give it a go!
<string>Hmm... What to do, what to do...?
<string>Oh, hiya, <PL>!<lf>Great timing! I was JUST in the middle<lf>of brainstorming some new recipes!
<string>Got any good ideas?<lf>Like, did you taste anything new out<lf>in Elgado that I could use?
<string>Actually, what kinds of food do people<lf>from the Kingdom eat? Like, what do<lf>they use for seasoning and stuff?
<string>I'm so curious now! Never mind, I'm gonna<lf>go ask Rondine! Seeeeee ya!
<string>Komitsu came and asked me about<lf>making different kinds of candy apples<lf>the other day, like I do with dango.
<string>I figured why not try something other<lf>than apples? Or how about using<lf>a different color instead of red?
<string>I'd never given it much thought before, but<lf>there are so many possibilities! Maybe<lf>I should do the same for my dango?
<string>...Ooh, I've just had a great idea!<lf>How about...candy dango!?
<string>Hmm... I'm not sure it's gonna work.<lf>But that's not gonna stop me from<lf>trying anyway!
<string>Oooooh! Hey, <PL>!<lf>Welcome back!
<string>Have a seat and I'll fix you up some<lf>dango. I'll just knock out a new batch<lf>of fifty or so for you!
<string>...Sorry, fifty's too many, isn't it?<lf>Right! You can't hunt with all<lf>that rolling around in your belly.
<string>I guess seeing Hinoa putting so many<lf>away each day has given me kind of<lf>a skewed view of what's appropriate...
<string>So about thirty, then?
<string>Hey, <PL>.<lf>Can I ask you something?
<string>I overheard Elder Fugen and Kagero<lf>saying something about "a princess"<lf>the other day.
<string>When I asked Elder Fugen about it,<lf>he was all like, "You'll learn when<lf>the time is right. Bwahaha!"
<string>But that made me even more curious!<lf>I guess I'll find out eventually, but still...
<string>I probably shouldn't worry about it for<lf>now, right? Yeah, good advice! OK,<lf>back to my dango!
