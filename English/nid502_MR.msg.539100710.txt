<string><NPC:502><CAM:0>...Long journey, hm?
<string><SCAM:2><LOOK:501,CAM,502,CAM>...I am <COLS RED>Galleus</COL>.
<string><NPC:501>Admiral Galleus is in charge of<lf>operations here at the Elgado Outpost.
<string>As his adjutant, it's my duty to support<lf>the Admiral in his work.
<string><MR_OPEN>So you'll be receiving mission<lf>assignments from me in accordance<lf>with the Admiral's wishes.
<string><NPC:501>To start with, I recommend exploring<lf>the Outpost. Get to know Elgado's<lf>people and its facilities.
<string>After all, this will be your home for<lf>the time being. It would be wise<lf>to get acquainted.
<string><NOTE:402>And everyone's excited to meet Kamura's<lf>ultimate hunter. I'm sure they're eager<lf>to introduce themselves.
<string>With the increase in monster attacks,<lf>morale has taken a hit. I'm hoping<lf>that your arrival will boost their spirits.
<string>That is if what your Elder Fugen says about<lf>you is true...
<string><CAM:5,6,7>Oh, before I forget. There's one person<lf>in particular you must meet first.
<string><COLS RED>Master Arlow</COL>, our advisor. He's been<lf>prodding me for a chance to meet you.<lf>Literally.
<string><SCAM:2>And I hear he has another visitor from<lf>Kamura, as well. Though I've no idea<lf>who it is...
<string><NPC:502><CAM:0>...Something's come up that concerns you.<lf>It's about Kamura Village.
<string><NPC:501><SCAM:2><LOOK:501,CAM,502,CAM>While it's true that the Rampage isn't<lf>over completely, your village has been<lf>largely unscathed thanks to you.
<string>So at the suggestion of Elder Fugen,<lf>Elgado and Kamura are to strengthen<lf>their ties and collaborate more.
<string><VO:SER>Sadly, there's a hitch. There's a <COLS RED>Tetranadon</COL><lf>being a nuisance in the Jungle.
<string>As a result, travel between our two<lf>lands is proving difficult.
<string>We were about to dispatch our knights<lf>to deal with the menace, but Elder Fugen<lf>suggested you for the task.
<string><VO:NOR>Since he has such faith in you, I'm sure<lf>you are capable. Would you mind getting<lf>the quest details from Chichae?
<string><NPC:502><CAM:0>Well done...
<string><NPC:501><SCAM:2><LOOK:501,CAM,502,CAM>Thanks to your efforts, the passage<lf>from Kamura to Elgado has opened up.
<string>This passage not only serves to increase<lf>commerce but to strengthen our bond.<lf>May our people prosper.
<string>And speaking of, Lady Hinoa, Lady Minoto,<lf>and Master Utsushi are already en route<lf>to visit you. Hehe. You're quite popular!
<string>Actually I had expected them to have<lf>already arrived. Oh, well. Patience is<lf>a virtue.
<string>While you wait for their arrival, why<lf>not see if Chichae has posted any<lf>new quests?
<string><NPC:502><CAM:0><VO:SER>...We've had an urgent message from<lf>Kamura.

<string><VO:SER>So the appearance of this Bishaten<lf>subspecies is due to the influence being<lf>spread by the Kingdom monsters...
<string><LOOK:502,501>...We cannot allow these monsters to continue<lf>invading other territories.
<string><NPC:501><VO:SIL>Agreed, sir.
<string>The researchers have discovered signs<lf>of the Kingdom's Three Lords. They're<lf>following their trail.
<string><LOOK:502,CAM>The Three Lords are all very powerful<lf>monsters. Elgado will need to show great<lf>solidarity here.

<string><SCAM:4><NPC:501>...Bahari. Was it not Malzeno that we believed<lf>was the driving force behind all of this<lf>chaos?
<string><LOOK:502,501>Because the way you're talking now makes<lf>it sound as if Qurio are the cause.
<string><SCAM:3><NPC:503>All Kingdom monster have suddenly gotten<lf>way more active, not just the Three Lords.
<string>Nothin' like this has ever happened<lf>before. I mean it's not the Rampage,<lf>but it's still a great migration.
<string>But the Rampage was caused by<lf>Ibushi and Narwa. As in, calamity-<lf>level elder dragons.
<string>Qurio are insects by comparison.<lf>It's inconceivable to think they alone<lf>could have this much influence.
<string>Right? So I'm still convinced an elder<lf>dragon within the Kingdom is the root<lf>cause. It's gotta be Malzeno.
<string><SCAM:4><NPC:501>But the Qurio are somehow involved.<lf>Is that what you're saying?
<string><SCAM:3><NPC:503>Yes.<lf>They might not be the whole story,<lf>but they're in there somewhere.

<string>Malzeno's finally graced the scene.<lf>It must be eliminated immediately.<lf>We WILL put an end to this.
<string><NPC:503><LOOK:503,502>Hold it, Admiral.<lf>I'm not on board with takin' out Malzeno.<lf>Not yet, at least.
<string><NPC:502><LOOK:502,503>...The Qurio?
<string><NPC:503>Yeah. This whole situation, it all started<lf>with monsters from our Kingdom pushin'<lf>into new territory.
<string>And their ultra-aggressive behavior started<lf>to influence other monsters. And then those<lf>monsters became aggressive, too.
<string>We still don't know the exact cause, but<lf>it's startin' to look a lot like it came about<lf>from those Qurio bites.
<string>And now we've got Malzeno thrown<lf>into the mix, one thing's pretty obvious.
<string><VO:NOR><LOOK:503,501>Do the honors, Fio.
<string><SCAM:4><NPC:501><VO:SER>Malzeno has been using the Qurio to drive<lf>other monsters into this hyper-aggressive<lf>state. Why? We do not know yet.

<string><VO:NOR><LOOK:501,CAM>And we gotta thank you, <PL>.<lf>We'd never have come this far without<lf>your help.

<string><NPC:503><VO:SER><LOOK:503,502>I hear ya. It seems like there's a link,<lf>but there's still a lot we don't know.
<string>Why is Malzeno using these Qurio?<lf>How does it even benefit from this<lf>whole situation?
<string>I say that until we figure that out, we<lf>can't go after Malzeno. It'd leave too<lf>many questions.
<string><NPC:502><VO:NOR><LOOK:502,CAM>Alright. We'll hold off on dealing<lf>with Malzeno.
<string>Fiorayne and <PL>, carry on with<lf>your assignments.
<string><LOOK:502,503>Bahari, get your answers. Easier said than<lf>done, but I put my trust in you to find<lf>a way. Now get to work.
<string><NPC:502><CAM:0><VO:SER><TURN:502,503><LOOK:502,503>...Fiorayne's unconscious?
<string><SCAM:2><LOOK:503,502>Bahari, was this due to the wound<lf>inflicted by Malzeno?
<string><NPC:503><VO:SER>Well, not so much the wound itself,<lf>it's what inside. Poison to be specific.
<string><NPC:502>If she's not responding to treatment,<lf>it's no ordinary poison.
<string><NPC:503>Correct. See the thing is, when I first<lf>examined her, there was no sign of it...
<string>But when I examined her again later,<lf>I found a substance almost identical to<lf>the one I extracted from the Qurio's fangs.
<string>The very same substance that's been<lf>makin' monsters go berserk. THIS is<lf>the root cause of this whole disaster.
<string><TURN:503,CAM><LOOK:503,CAM>And that raises a question, doesn't it?<lf>You know what I'm talkin' about, right,<lf><PL>?
<string>Why did I find Qurio poison in<lf>a wound inflicted by Malzeno?
<string><VO:SER>The answer's simple. Malzeno's body<lf>is coursin' with Qurio juice.
<string>But for some reason, it doesn't turn<lf>Mal crazy. It only makes it stronger.
<string>And that just gives the Qurio more to<lf>feed on. They're parasites, livin' off<lf>Malzeno. It's win-win.
<string>In other words, it's a symbiosis. Malzeno<lf>and the Qurio are both usin' each other.
<string>In the monsters we've analyzed up to now,<lf>the Qurio poison was absorbed in the blood,<lf>so it was impossible to detect.
<string>But in a human, it didn't fully mix, so<lf>when I analyzed Fio's wound, I picked<lf>it up. And now we've gotten our answer.
<string>The timing of the effect on Fiorayne kickin'<lf>in more or less coincides with that of the<lf>monsters that had been bitten...
<string>So I am sure of my deduction! The thing<lf>that really bothers me is that I didn't<lf>notice any of this sooner...
<string><NPC:502><TURN:502,CAM><LOOK:502,CAM>Yes, rather unfortunate. As was Fiorayne's<lf>recklessness. Be that as it may...
<string>The responsibility ultimately lies with me,<lf>for not picking up on this anomaly and<lf>letting things get this far...
<string><NPC:503><TURN:503,502><LOOK:503,502>And therein lies the true danger of<lf>the Qurio. You won't know what hit<lf>ya until it's too late.
<string><LOOK:502,503>Even the monsters that were bitten didn't<lf>know what was happenin' to them until<lf>the moment they lost control.
<string><NPC:502>Hmm...
<string><LOOK:502,CAM>Is there anything we can do for Fiorayne?
<string><NPC:503><TURN:503,CAM><LOOK:502,503,503,CAM>...<PL>.<lf>There's this Wyverian doctor, <COLS RED>Tadori</COL>.
<string>Years ago, when Malzeno decimated<lf>the Kingdom, a terrible plague followed.
<string>Doctor Tadori was able to develop a treat-<lf>ment that saved countless lives. Now he<lf>mostly spends his time out in the field...
<string>And he travels around so much that no one really<lf>knows where to find him. However, he has an<lf>old friend in Kamura, the merchant, <COLS RED>Kagero</COL>...
<string><LOOK:502,CAM>Maybe Kagero knows where to find<lf>Doctor Tadori?
<string><COLOR FF0000>#Rejected#</COLOR> nid502_mr4_002_010
<string>We have to solve this<lf>Qurio issue...
<string><NPC:502><CAM:1>You found Tadori. Good work.
<string><SCAM:3><NPC:503><LOOK:502,504,503,504>Doctor Tadori! My man! It's been a while,<lf>huh? Welcome to Elgado! We could really<lf>use your help here.
<string><SCAM:9><NPC:504><LOOK:504,503>Glad to see you're still the same old<lf>overly energetic soul, Bahari.
<string>Master <PL> here has told me all<lf>about your predicament. I've also read your<lf>report on Malzeno, the Qurio, etcetera.
<string><SCAM:3><NPC:503>Great! Then you're up to speed already.<lf>So? Can you cook us up something to help<lf>Fio?
<string>I mean, I know it's a tall order. We're not<lf>dealing with the same thing that caused<lf>the plague fifty years back.
<string><SCAM:9><NPC:504>Actually, the medicine I created back then<lf>will work perfectly for this situation.
<string><SCAM:3><NPC:503>Wait, what!? How!?
<string><SCAM:9><NPC:504>This poison afflicting Lady Fiorayne now<lf>is precisely the same as that which once<lf>inflicted sufferers of the plague.
<string>It's not really a poison at all. It's a virus.<lf>A virus somewhat similar to another<lf>known as "The Frenzy."
<string><SCAM:3><NPC:503><LOOK:503,CAM>Hold on a minute! No one's followin'<lf>this, Tadori. I mean, d'you get that,<lf><PL>?
<string>Right!? That's a relief. I was like,<lf>what is this man talkin' about!?
<string><LOOK:503,504>So, Doc, this poison in Fio... Or rather,<lf>this virus... We know the Qurio carry it,<lf>and so does Malzeno.
<string>But the last time Malzeno was around,<lf>there were no Qurio in sight.
<string><SCAM:9><NPC:504>You're assuming that the Qurio seen<lf>today look as they did back then.
<string><SCAM:3><NPC:502>...Still juveniles, perhaps? Too small<lf>to notice?
<string><NPC:503>Riiight. So the symbiosis with Malzeno<lf>hadn't developed yet, and the juvenile Qurio<lf>preyed on humans instead of monsters.
<string>So that was what the plague really was<lf>and why the virus ripped through the<lf>population like it did.
<string><SCAM:9><NPC:504>Yes, and no. See, humans are not a food<lf>source for the Qurio. So Qurio that couldn't<lf>coexist with Malzeno died out naturally.
<string>Anyway, the task at hand is to treat<lf>Lady Fiorayne. It will not take long<lf>to prepare an antiviral medication.
<string><LOOK:504,CAM>Ah, and one more thing,<lf>Master <PL>.
<string>Kagero's words that you relayed to me<lf>as we traveled here... They touched<lf>me very deeply.
<string>To know that the young lady my master<lf>had entrusted to Kagero is safe and well...<lf>It's wonderful news.
<string>I left one day to gather herbs as usual,<lf>but while I was gone, my hometown was—<lf>I've never forgiven myself since.
<string>I did write to Kagero, but having failed<lf>my people by not protecting the village,<lf>I couldn't face him.
<string>But his kind words that you passed on<lf>gave me courage. And I can't thank you<lf>enough for that.
<string><LOOK:503,CAM>*ahem* Forgive me, I must stop muttering<lf>and start making medicine, mustn't I?<lf>I'll let you know as soon as it's ready.
<string><SCAM:3><NPC:502><LOOK:502,CAM>...<PL>, Carry on with your<lf>assignments. Chichae has plenty of quests<lf>to keep you busy.

<string><SCAM:4><NPC:501><VO:SER><LOOK:501,503,503,501>Perhaps what you said about resonance<lf>wasn't all talk, Bahari.
<string>This is certainly a new level of activity from<lf>the Qurio. Is it because they are without<lf>a host that they behave in this manner?

<string>First hypothesis:<lf>They're survivin' autonomously now.
<string>Second hypothesis:<lf>They've found a new host.
<string>I'm gonna go ahead and shoot that first<lf>idea down. If they didn't need a host to<lf>survive, then they didn't need Malzeno.
<string>The second idea's more plausible.<lf>But then who's the new host?
<string><SCAM:4><NPC:501><LOOK:502,501>Surely not another Malzeno... There'd<lf>be another crater if that were the case.<lf>And there's no reports of the sort.
<string><SCAM:3><NPC:503>Exactly, Fio.
<string>The crater that wrecked the capital and<lf>the one that opened up here were both<lf>due to Malzeno.

<string><SCAM:4><NPC:501><VO:SER><LOOK:501,503>So...it's not a fairy tale?
<string><SCAM:3><NPC:503>Ages ago, people in the Kingdom reported a<lf>ferocious bellowing coming from deep beneath<lf>them. That's where the story started.
<string><LOOK:503,502>Back when the Admiral was a boy,<lf>his home—the place we call the Citadel<lf>today—was attacked by Malzeno.
<string><LOOK:502,503>People heard those same bellowing sounds<lf>then too, right, Admiral? Risin' up from the<lf>bowels of the earth.
<string><NPC:502>...Hm.
<string><LOOK:502,501>As the rumbling proceeded, Malzeno circled<lf>above...as if waiting for something.
<string>No link was proven, but in my mind,<lf>I was sure that the Archdemon was real.<lf>And that it was connected to Malzeno.
<string>So when I became admiral, I told Her<lf>Majesty and Bahari. And I ordered the<lf>ship's construction.
<string><SCAM:4><NPC:501><LOOK:501,502>And you've been proven right this time.<lf>The Archdemon of the Abyss finally surfaced...
<string><LOOK:501,503>Is that the Qurio's new host?
<string><SCAM:3><NPC:503><LOOK:503,501>More like "true" host. This latest<lf>incident has answered a lot of<lf>questions.
<string>To start with, the mysterious craters.<lf>They weren't made by Malzeno at all.<lf>They're made by the Archdemon.
<string>When Malzeno, the elder dragon ruler of the<lf>Kingdom, gets a whiff of something invadin'<lf>its territory, it goes to check it out...
<string>It was all just a gigantic turf war, basically.<lf>One that the rest of us got dragged into.<lf>But they didn't fight it out right away...
<string>The Archdemon's never surfaced before, so we<lf>all assumed the craters were Malzeno's doin'.<lf>But, c'mon. Look at the size of them!
<string><SCAM:4><NPC:501>I see. And the Qurio were the Archdemon's<lf>parting shot against Malzeno.
<string>They were left to feed on the surface<lf>before returning to their true host...
<string><SCAM:3><NPC:503>Right. And now it's gotten all that<lf>energy from the Qurio, so there's<lf>no tellin' how powerful it is now...
<string>The Kingdom's never been a threat. I mean,<lf>it's nearly wiped it out twice. And now its<lf>number one enemy is out of the picture...
<string>All our new ship did was buy us some<lf>time. If that thing surfaces, we're toast.
<string><SCAM:4><NPC:501>...We mustn't give in to fear.

<string>I hope I may count on you for your continued<lf>assistance moving forward.

<string><NPC:502><CAM:1>You defeated Scorned Magnamalo.<lf>Well done. I was confident you'd be<lf>able to, nevertheless I'm filled with awe.
<string><NPC:503><SCAM:3><LOOK:502,CAM,503,CAM>I gotta say, your courage has set the hearts<lf>of everyone here in Elgado ablaze, giving<lf>us the strength to keep pushing forward.

<string>I have a request.
<string>Your fierce spirit has protected Elgado.<lf>And with the Archdemon of the Abyss<lf>gone, the Kingdom is at peace.
<string>Yet a new peril threatens us...<lf>A troubling report from the Shrine Ruins<lf>has come in.
<string>All of the monsters that have appeared<lf>are fierce adversaries that we cannot<lf>allow to run rampant.
<string>A strike force was to be assembled,<lf>but the Order is currently stretched<lf>thin as it is...
<string>I apologize for once again asking you to<lf>shoulder yet another daunting request,<lf>but I cannot think of anyone more capable.
<string>...To the hunting grounds!
<string>...<PL>.<lf>Do you perhaps have time?
<string>If you agree, I would enjoy your company<lf>on the hunt.
<string>The quest details are ready.<lf>Accept it when it suits you.
<string>You have my thanks...
<string>Thank you for your assistance...
<string>Should have been a job for the Royal Order,<lf>but the task at hand was something<lf>suited for more capable hands.
<string>Your assistance in the matter was of great<lf>help. This is for you.
<string>...To the hunting grounds!
<string>...<PL>.<lf>Do you perhaps have time?
<string>I apologize for the multitude of requests,<lf>but I require your assistance once again.
<string>The details are already available.<lf>So once you're ready...
<string>You have my thanks...
<string>I must express my gratitude for<lf>your assistance once again...
<string>The Royal Order has been training in<lf>the Jungle as of late, and unexpected<lf>monsters are a constant threat.
<string>Your help was invaluable.<lf>...Please take this.
<string>...To the hunting grounds!
<string>...<PL>.<lf>Do you perhaps have time?
<string>I must apologize but I require your assistance<lf>yet again.
<string>The details have already been posted.<lf>Accept it when it suits you.
<string>You have my thanks...
<string>I must express my gratitude for<lf>your assistance once again...
<string>...That creature has ambushed many<lf>a mission as of late.
<string>Such a nasty piece of work...<lf>I appreciate your expeditiousness<lf>in the matter.
<string>I shall return the favor when you<lf>find it suitable.
<string>...To the hunting grounds!
<string>...<PL>.<lf>Do you perhaps have time?
<string>A troublesome beast has appeared in the<lf>Lava Caverns. I wish for a small team to<lf>eliminate it before more chaos ensues.
<string>I request that you accompany me to deal<lf>with this matter swiftly. Please accept<lf>the quest as soon as you are able.
<string>You have my thanks...
<string>...Exceptional skill.
<string>Even I have much to learn from your talents.<lf>I hope that your influence spreads through<lf>the Order.
<string>Your help has once again been invaluable.<lf>...Please take this.
<string>...To the hunting grounds!
<string>...<PL>.<lf>Do you perhaps have time?
<string>I have a message for Kamura. We're are indebted<lf>to you. For everything. From lending your talents<lf>to the craftsmanship of your people.
<string>As commander of this outpost, I'd like to<lf>extend my thanks to your Elder Fugen<lf>in person.
<string>...I hear he is a man of strength and passion.
<string>But rather than just meeting around a table,<lf>I'd sooner go hunting together. With you,<lf>as well.
<string>Now that I have delivered my message...<lf>The details have been posted, accept<lf>it when it suits you.
<string>You have my thanks...
<string>...I'm grateful for your company on<lf>the quest.
<string>And your Elder Fugen has my utmost<lf>respect. ...Truly the man to lead Kamura<lf>through the Rampage.
<string>Having overcome countless hardships<lf>together, Kamura's spirit is unwavering.
<string>...You come from a fine home.
<string>Fate has brought us together. When our<lf>respective troubles have been resolved,<lf>I hope our relationship endures.
<string>I have a job for you.
<string>I have a small request, if you can<lf>find the time.
<string>There's a mighty weapon of exceptional<lf>craftsmanship that I believe, if upgraded,<lf>would benefit our efforts here greatly.
<string>I asked Minayle to look into it, and in <lf>order to improve its capabilities, it <lf>needs materials from a Shogun Ceanataur.
<string>Capture one and we may proceed.<lf>Should you do so, surely you will<lf>be able to upgrade yours, as well.
<string>Well done.
<string>Thanks to your efforts, we may now<lf>proceed with upgrading the weapon's<lf>capabilities.
<string>I believe Minayle is working the materials<lf>as we speak. Perhaps you should pay<lf>her a visit?
<string>Weapon development is crucial for our<lf>operation here. I hope that I may count<lf>on you should another opportunity arise.
<string>Your cooperation is needed.
<string>We've had a request from the Hunter's<lf>Guild. I'd like you to take it on.
<string>Seems Barioth-related trouble is on the<lf>rise, possibly due to recent developments.<lf>The Guild wants a specimen for research.
<string>Though not directly related to our own<lf>investigations, the Kingdom agreed to<lf>the request to maintain good relations.
<string>And whoever brings the beast will get<lf>permission from the Guild to use some<lf>special gear. Go get it done.
<string>Well done.
<string>Thanks to your efforts, we'll be able to<lf>supply the Guild with the Barioth they<lf>asked for.
<string>Minayle has been given the designs for<lf>the special gear. I hope that you put it<lf>to good use.
<string>Guild support is needed to further our<lf>investigations. I hope that I may count<lf>on you in the future, as well.
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>Had a look around yet?
<string>As you are our esteemed guest, we'll<lf>provide you with whatever you need.
<string>Just ask Fiorayne or myself.
<string>I hear Master Utsushi has summoned you<lf>back to Kamura?
<string>One can never have too much training.<lf>Safe journey.
<string>You've returned.<lf>And sooner than I expected.
<string>I hope you put that time to good use.<lf>I look forward to seeing you put what<lf>you've learned to practice.
<string>Seeing her working alongside everyone<lf>else, one might find it hard to believe<lf>that Chichae is our beloved princess.
<string>Yet despite her status, she insisted<lf>on coming to the frontline.
<string>And now she's a quest receptionist.<lf>Please, treat her accordingly. That's<lf>the way she wants it.
<string>The request came from Elder Fugen.<lf>He wishes for Elgado and Kamura to<lf>strengthen their ties.
<string>An offer I accepted without hesitation.
<string>Therefore this situation must be handled<lf>swiftly. Your mission's clear. Don't waste<lf>any time.
<string>Safe passage between Kamura and Elgado<lf>has been assured. Thank you.
<string>I hear we already have visitors from<lf>Kamura on their way as we speak.
<string>Perhaps they've arrived already?<lf>Fiorayne's right; you are popular.
<string>I think I raised some eyebrows when<lf>I lost my temper earlier. Forgive me.
<string>If you can spare the time, perhaps you<lf>could check in with Fiorayne and see<lf>how she's doing.
<string>The influence is spreading further...<lf>Kamura was but only the first of several<lf>neighboring territories reporting attacks.
<string>I have deployed those of the Order<lf>stationed in Elgado in response.
<string>We cannot allow these attacks to continue.<lf>These monsters must be stopped.
<string>He only has himself to blame if something<lf>were to happen.
<string>Yet, I must ask that you rescue him. Despite<lf>his quirks, he is vital to our operation here.
<string>And after all that effort, he still didn't<lf>return to base. * sigh* Fool...
<string>Still, the experience has provided Fiorayne<lf>with a valuable lesson.
<string>I suppose it wasn't a complete waste of time.<lf>Continue with your assignments.
<string>Time to finally face the first of the Three Lords.<lf>Prepare well.
<string>I have given this assignment to you because<lf>I have the utmost confidence that you will<lf>fulfill your duty. Get it done.
<string>Bahari is what you would call an "acquired<lf>taste." Despite his personality, his skills<lf>are undeniable.
<string>Until there are further developments,<lf>keep working on quests.
<string>Such a tiny creature...responsible for<lf>all of this?
<string>To notice such a minute detail in such<lf>little time. Impressive.
<string>Bahari will take care of the Qurio.<lf>You have your orders. Get it done.
<string>Thanks to you, we have what we needed.<lf>Well done.
<string>Leave the rest to Bahari. I imagine<lf>he's already locked himself in his lab.<lf>Probably won't come out for days...
<string>Another Lord...<lf>We need this monster dealt with<lf>so Bahari can get what he needs.
<string>And, <PL>... Both Fiorayne<lf>and Bahari can get careless if left to their<lf>own devices. Please look out for them.
<string>Initially, we were to focus all our efforts<lf>on Malzeno. But right now, we can't.
<string>The Qurio pose an equally dangerous<lf>threat, so we must face both adversaries<lf>at once.
<string>Bahari's working as fast as he can to<lf>understand these curious creatures. We<lf>have to put our faith in him...and wait.
<string><VO:SER>I'm worried about Fiorayne and the Qurio's<lf>poison coursing through her veins...
<string>If there's any way to treat her, I don't want<lf>to waste any time. Find Doctor Tadori.
<string>Doctor Tadori will take care of treating<lf>Fiorayne.
<string>We have more threats to deal with. Thanks<lf>to the Qurio, they're more active than ever.
<string>I'm worried about Fiorayne, of course...<lf>But we cannot let this chaos continue.<lf>You have your orders.
<string>More potent medicine is needed.
<string>Hunting an Espinas...<lf>Shouldn't be a problem for someone<lf>who's dealt with the Three Lords.
<string>Thank you for hunting the Espinas.<lf>Without you, we would've struggled to<lf>get Fiorayne the treatment she needs.
<string>We're overstretched already. The Order<lf>has its hands full guarding the Outpost<lf>and dealing with monsters.
<string>I'm sorry to have to ask you once again,<lf>but I need you to handle this.
<string>Fiorayne's back on her feet at last.<lf>It wouldn't have happened without<lf>your help. Thank you.
<string>But there's no time to celebrate.<lf>We've located Malzeno.
<string>The Order has been mobilized. This time<lf>we take the fight to Malzeno!
<string>It is my ardent wish to join you in this<lf>fight, but as admiral, I cannot. You have<lf>your orders. Don't waste any time.
<string>A superb victory.<lf>The Kingdom's nemesis is no more.<lf>Thank you.
<string>However, the Qurio's influence remains...<lf>We cannot let our guard down just yet.
<string>Eliminating Malzeno is fruitless if the<lf>chaos continues. There's more work<lf>to be done.
<string>As for the ship I've requested, I will shed<lf>light on its purpose when the time is right.
<string>There's enough chaos as it is...<lf>You have your orders. Continue with<lf>your assignments.
<string>We cannot ignore Bahari's report.<lf>A storm is brewing...let's call it<lf>admiral's intuition.
<string>We must remain on high alert.<lf>Don't let your guard down.
<string>To think the Qurio are capable of such<lf>a thing...
<string>You've eliminated Malzeno...<lf>What's controlling them now?
<string>And now the skies have darkened...<lf>It appears my assumptions were<lf>correct.
<string>I'm tasking the Chevaliers to help Bahari<lf>with his investigations. Continue your<lf>assignments.
<string>......<lf>(Could the Citadel really be cursed by<lf>the Archdemon of the Abyss...? Hmmm...)
<string>The Qurio are gathering; don't waste any time.
<string>Anything could happen, so be prepared.
<string>This is no fairy tale. The Archdemon of<lf>the Abyss is real. I apologize for keeping<lf>this information from you.
<string>When I was a boy, I heard the beast bellowing<lf>from the deep as my home was destroyed.<lf>I knew then that it was no fairy tale.
<string>But no investigations ever revealed<lf>anything to prove its existence.<lf>That is...until now.
<string>When I became admiral, I tasked the<lf>Chevaliers with proving my theory.<lf>It's taken quite some time...
<string>In anticipation of our eventual<lf>confrontation, I requested a ship to be<lf>built in the Capital. Hunter of Kamura...
<string>I call upon your strength. May the sun's light<lf>break through these darkened skies and rid<lf>our Kingdom of this calamity forever!
<string>I can't thank you enough for staying on<lf>in Elgado.
<string>You defeated Malzeno, and rid us of<lf>the Archdemon of the Abyss, as well.<lf>The Kingdom is forever grateful.
<string>First "Savior of Kamura" and now "Hero<lf>of the Kingdom." Weighty labels, both<lf>of them. But honorable.
<string>I hope the fire that burns in you serves<lf>as a guiding light for the Kingdom for<lf>many years to come.
<string>Afflicted monsters...
<string>Normal behavior for self-preservation in<lf>the natural world, but with...uncomfortable<lf>consequences.
<string>As long as this violent behavior continues,<lf>there will be fallout. Don't waste any time.
<string>Wind Serpent Ibushi...<lf>Kamura's nemesis has reared its ugly head.
<string>Not much is known within the Kingdom about<lf>this catastrophic elder dragon...
<string>So I ask that you handle this situation.<lf>Don't waste any time.
<string>Narwa the Allmother...<lf>Its influence is whipping the Kingdom<lf>monsters into a frenzy.
<string>We will not allow this situation to escalate<lf>further. I'm mobilizing everyone in the Order<lf>to counter this new threat.
<string>This is our chance to repay Kamura!<lf>Eliminate the Allmother. We'll take<lf>care of the rest!
<string>I don't have to remind you of the severity<lf>of this situation.
<string>We cannot let such a violent beast go<lf>unchecked.
<string>You have your orders. Get it done.
<string>Fiorayne was right...<lf>Everything's falling to you to handle.
<string>But Bahari made a good point, too.<lf>We have to keep Elgado's chain of<lf>command intact.
<string>You already know that this Valstrax<lf>variant is extremely dangerous. You<lf>have your orders. Get it done.
<string>Scorned Magnamalo...<lf>It's waited until now to show itself.<lf>Like it's been waiting for the perfect time.
<string>Young Iori requested that you take care<lf>of it personally. Seems Master Hamon<lf>is rather upset about its existence.
<string>Be on your guard out there. We do not<lf>yet know what its capable of. You have<lf>your orders. Get it done.

<string>Not everyone here in Elgado is from<lf>the Kingdom. Some just ended up here...
<string>But no matter where one hails from,<lf>we are all invested in this place.
<string>And as admiral, I have a responsibility<lf>for everyone's wellbeing.
<string>I've only exchanged correspondence<lf>with your Elder Fugen. We've not yet<lf>met in person.
<string>But the impression I get is that he's<lf>a strong, wise, and extremely capable<lf>leader.
<string>Despite our busy schedules, it is my hope<lf>that we may find time to someday meet.
<string>This fortress was destroyed the last time<lf>Malzeno emerged...
<string>Rather than rebuild it as it was, it was decided<lf>to turn it into an outpost. Mostly to observe<lf>the crater.
<string>Thanks to everyone's tireless laboring,<lf>it's a fine base now. Hard to believe<lf>it was but a ruin not long ago.
<string>Bunny Dango are a perfect snack when<lf>doing physical labor.
<string>You can eat them on the move, add flavor...
<string>And it's possible to work in extra<lf>nutrients. Kamura's ingenuity never<lf>ceases to amaze me.
<string>Fiorayne has changed...<lf>It's a good thing.
<string>She's no longer obsessed with sacrificing<lf>everything for queen and country.
<string>I think that when I initially sent her to<lf>Kamura, your Elder Fugen noticed the<lf>innate danger in her character, as well.
<string>And perhaps the reason he chose to<lf>send you. I must thank your Elder Fugen.
<string>With you accompanying her on her<lf>missions, she had to restrain her reckless<lf>urges.
<string>The threats facing Elgado have all been<lf>eliminated.
<string>You saved the Kingdom...<lf>A kingdom far from your home of Kamura.
<string>And when the Qurio's influence has<lf>vanished, this outpost may be abandoned...<lf>But I will still be admiral.
<string>And together with the Order, we will<lf>work tirelessly to ensure peace prevails<lf>throughout the Kingdom AND Kamura.
<string>Well done.
<string><PL>.<lf>I've been reporting every detail of<lf>your contributions to the capital.
<string>And in recognition of your deeds,<lf>Her Majesty has granted you this ticket.<lf>Here, take it.
<string>We're forever in your debt.
<string>Well done.
<string><PL>.<lf>Your incredible, daily service to the<lf>Kingdom has earned you this ticket.
<string>...Take it.<lf>With our thanks.
