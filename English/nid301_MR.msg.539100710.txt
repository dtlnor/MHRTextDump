<string>...<PL>. I have been informed<lf>by Elder Fugen that your journey shall<lf>take you to a new land.
<string>I, too, shall survey the area for any<lf>abnormalities among the monsters. I wish<lf>you good fortune in your endeavors.
<string>The situation with the invading monsters<lf>has yet to diminish in severity. We must<lf>gird our loins for what lies ahead.
<string>If you are to leave Kamura—to confront<lf>the Kingdom monsters—the hunt shall<lf>be unlike any you have encountered.
<string>Keep your guard up and remember<lf>your training.
<string>...<PL>. You have returned.<lf>I trust you have acclimated yourself to<lf>hunting in the Kingdom.
<string>You may be thrown off by the unfamiliar<lf>environment, but the ability to swiftly adapt<lf>oneself is the mark of a true hunter.
<string>Indeed, the people of Kamura have<lf>gone through great effort to craft an<lf>environment to foster such adaptation.
<string>If ever you find yourself at an impasse,<lf>I implore you to lean on Elder Fugen,<lf>and the rest of us in this village.
<string>A peculiar wind is blowing... An<lf>abhorrent flurry, unlike that of the<lf>Rampage.
<string>I implore you to remain ever vigilant,<lf><PL>.
<string>I, too, received orders from Elder Fugen<lf>to visit the people of Elgado.
<string>Yet I was charged with an urgent errand,<lf>one I was compelled to attend to before<lf>I could speak with you.
<string>For you to visit of your own accord<lf>brings this old Felyne no small<lf>measure of joy.
<string>I would indulge in this opportunity to<lf>hear tales of Elgado, and any other<lf>noteworthy accounts of your travels.
<string>...<PL>. You return once again.<lf>Ah, but no... I believe "welcome home"<lf>is more suitable here.
<string>Your name has reached the Kingdom's<lf>shore and now it echoes throughout,<lf>along with the name of our humble village.
<string>Elder Fugen could not be prouder. And<lf>not only him: Hojo, Hamon, and the rest<lf>of the villagers as well.
<string>I, too, count myself among the exultant.<lf>Yet more than anything, it is your safe<lf>return that brings us the most joy.
<string>Elder Fugen has informed me that you,<lf>together with Master Utsushi, will face<lf>an Amatsu...
<string>Now is your chance to avenge Kagero<lf>all while protecting our village. You must<lf>prevail. I am confident that you will.
<string><PL>, once again the village<lf>is in your debt.
<string>Thanks to you, the villagers never lost<lf>hope, even in the face of countless<lf>dangers and disasters.
<string>May your brightly burning soul shine on<lf>this village forever more.
