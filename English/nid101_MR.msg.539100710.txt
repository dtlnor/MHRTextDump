<string>So, <PL>, the time has finally<lf>come for you to leave the pond?
<string>You can rest easy knowing the village<lf>will be in good hands while you are gone.
<string>You've done a great job of protecting<lf>the village, but I won't be outdone by<lf>a tadpole like you! Johoho!
<string>I will admit that you have been most<lf>dependable, and so I may call on you<lf>when the need arises.
<string>Johoho! Young Utsushi has not shut up<lf>since your departure from the village.
<string>I told him that there was no need to worry,<lf>that everything would be fine, but my words<lf>appear to have fallen on deaf ears...
<string>Johoho! So, how's it going?
<string>What are you doing wasting your time<lf>here? Johoho!
<string>You were summoned to Elgado with<lf>the hopes and wishes of everyone<lf>here. Don't let us down!
<string>Surely you have a lot on your plate,<lf>with the Kingdom's monsters and all...
<string>But there's no urgent need to return just<lf>yet. Sometimes rest is necessary to keep<lf>moving forward. Come, let us feast! Johoho!
<string>Malzeno... The elder dragon that continues<lf>to plague the Kingdom. I've heard tales<lf>of its many horrors.
<string>Plague or no plague, the fire that burns<lf>inside you will guide you on the path<lf>to victory!
<string>Hop to it-to it and show them what<lf>a hunter from Kamura Village can<lf>really do!
<string>Although it brings me great joy to see you<lf>doing so well beyond our village walls,<lf>I admit I am a bit-bit...sad.
<string>Alas, this is what it's like to get old.<lf>Go out and make your mark. Leave<lf>the sentimentality to us elders...
<string>Hmm? Oh, I'm not missing you or anything<lf>like that! Johoho! There's plenty here to<lf>keep me occupied!
<string>Johoho, <PL>!<lf>How's it going?
<string>Well, tadpole, you've not only become<lf>the hero of the Village, but hero of the<lf>Kingdom as well!
<string>And as an elder of this village, I couldn't<lf>be prouder of you.
<string>But that doesn't mean you should start taking<lf>it easy on your quests though. There's still<lf>more for you to do! Now, hop to it-to it!
<string>I never thought I'd see the day when you<lf>would leave the village. And now you're<lf>off to work for the Kingdom! Johoho!
<string>I've always been well aware of your<lf>potential, so it comes as no surprise.<lf>I knew you would leave sooner or later...
<string>I've known you since you were in diapers,<lf>and now look at you. It fills my heart<lf>with joy to see how far you've come.
<string>I hear Hinoa and Minoto have also been<lf>spending some time in Elgado.
<string>Minoto was a little reluctant at first, but<lf>Hinoa's enthusiasm won her over. Minoto<lf>is not one to leave Hinoa all by herself.
<string>They're still a little on the shy side, but<lf>I'm sure some dango will draw them out<lf>of their shell. At least, Hinoa! Johoho!
<string>If you run into them don't forget to<lf>say hi. I'm sure they'll be relieved to<lf>see a friendly face.
<string>Since returning to the village Ayame has<lf>been a completely different person.<lf>So full of life!
<string>It seems like tales of your heroism may<lf>be having a positive effect on her.
<string>Although she can be reckless at times,<lf>Ayame has always excelled in the art<lf>of hunting.
<string>Yet I sense a slight change in her.<lf>She'll be an even better hunter when<lf>she returns!
<string>Don't you be reckless now, ya hear?<lf>Johoho!
<string>How's it going, <PL>?
<string>What's the matter? You been missin' this<lf>old man already? Johoho!
<string>Well, of course you have! It's no surprise,<lf>really! How long has it been since we've<lf>hopped along together?
<string>Taishi's strength has grown leaps<lf>and bounds of late.
<string>Hearing tales of your many heroic deeds<lf>is truly lighting a fire in his belly. Utsushi<lf>will have his work cut out for him.
<string>He's one step away from becoming<lf>an official hunter...or was it one hop?<lf>Perhaps two? Who knows! Johoho!
<string>*ahem* ...Come to think of it, there was<lf>a time when you were like that too,<lf>wasn't there? Ahhh the good ol' days...
<string>I have little doubt Taishi shall be a great<lf>hunter like you before long. Johoho! I will<lf>watch his growth with great interest...
<string>I'm pleased to hear that Kagero has<lf>come to call Kamura his second home.
<string>It's a miracle he's even still working<lf>at all, considering the injuries he<lf>sustained...
<string>We have Zenchi's treatment to thank<lf>for that. And, of course, Kagero's will<lf>to continue on...
<string>The urge to protect that which you hold<lf>dear will push you beyond your limits, but<lf>in the end, it will make you stronger.
<string>So this Amatsu destroyed Yomogi and<lf>Kagero's home... And now it's ready<lf>to leap onto ours, as well.
<string>I remember like it was yesterday that<lf>a beaten and bruised Kagero arrived here<lf>with baby Yomogi...
<string>You must avenge all of the innocent lives<lf>that were lost that day. We're counting<lf>on you! Now, hop to it-to it!
<string>Ah, <PL>! So Amatsu's storm<lf>fizzled out, did it-did it!? You have my<lf>deepest thanks!
<string>I had no idea Yomogi even remembered that<lf>fated day... We always wanted to tell her, but<lf>with the ever-present threat of the Rampage...
<string>Well, anyway...all's well that ends well, eh?<lf>If everyone's happy and smiling, then there's<lf>nothing more to it-to it!
