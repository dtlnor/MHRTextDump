<string>Oh, this is a dilly of a pickle!
<string><VO:SER>Oh, just the person I was looking for! ~♪<lf>We, uh, need to talk.
<string>So get this: the Chevaliers got asked to<lf>hunt a doomy gloomy Gore Magala because<lf>the Royal Order is "too busy" to... *sigh*
<string>Can you believe that!? Don't they know<lf>we already have, like, a gazillion other<lf>things to take care of!? Uh, HELLO!
<string>...What? I don't look busy!? HAHAHAHAHA<lf>HAHA—no. You're obviously suffering from<lf>some serious perception issues, buddy!
<string>I'd give you the run down but it's all SUPER<lf>secret Chevalier stuff. But trust me, I'm up<lf>to my elbows here!
<string>Soooooo, I was wondering if possibly...<lf>maybe we can dump—uh, entrust this<lf>itty bitty wittle request to you.
<string>You'll do it? Wow! Thank yooooooou! ~♪<lf>Oh, I almost forgot... THE REPORT!<lf>I wasn't really paying attention but...
<string>It said something about how <COLS RED>this Gore Magala<lf>is, uh, different from a normal one.</COL> Sounds<lf>sketch to me, but I'm sure you'll be fine! ~♪
<string>Thanks for your help!~~~♪
<string>Oh, I heard you took down that Gore Magala!<lf>Who'da thunk it was one of the really nasty<lf>ones, eh? Haha, certainly not me! Ha...ha...
<string>*ahem* Anyway, uh, thanks to you, we're<lf>able to concentrate on our Chevalier stuff!<lf>Thanks for being a sweetheart! ~♪
<string>And for bein' a sweetheart, I'll let you in on<lf>a li'l secret: We've been investigatin' the<lf>monster that destroyed Tadori's hometown.
<string>You know, the same place that your Kagero<lf>and Yomogi come from.
<string>This is just between you and me, by the<lf>way, don't let anyone know I told you! ~♪<lf>Not if you want to keep both your legs!
<string>Anyway, thanks again! And DON'T forget<lf>what I said! Well, forget that one thing, but<lf>not the part about your legs! Bye bye! ~♪
<string>Your Pazzy Poo has a request for you! ~♪
<string>Oh, Hunter Poo! Can you do me a favor,<lf>pretty pretty please, Louise!? ~♪
<string>So you know how Prized Mushrooms grow<lf>in the Jungle, right? Well I need to go<lf>gather some, but...
<string>It's so hot and icky and sticky out there!<lf>If you'd go and pick the slimy 'shrooms<lf>for me, I'd truly be eternally grateful! ~♪
<string>What do you say? Do we have a deal?<lf>I'll help you upgrade a super cutesy-cute<lf>weapon if you do! Please! Pretty please!
<string>Your Pazzy Poo wants to thank you! ~♪
<string>You really went out there to that horrible<lf>place and got those mushrooms for me?<lf>Oh, Hunter Poooooo! Thank yooooou! ~♪
<string>Head to the Smithy and you'll find the<lf>cute hammer upgrade waiting to go! Get<lf>out there and crush, crush, crush it!
<string>Oh, and speaking of crushing things! ~♪<lf>I hope you can spare some time to go out<lf>hunting with your Pazzy Poo sometime! ~♪
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>Well, hello there! ~♪ You're a fresh face<lf>'round these parts!
<string>Why, me? I'm Elgado's signature<lf>songstress of boundless beauty:<lf>Paz the Chevalier! ~♪
<string>Oh, I'm more than just a pretty face!<lf>Come hunting and see for yourself. ~♪<lf>Pleased to meet ya, Flame of Kamura! ~♪
<string>Mmmm-MMM, what a DAY, what a day! ~♪<lf>The sea's sparkling, the sun's shining<lf>like a big ol’ gem!
<string>I'm a Chevalier, see? Can't go slacking<lf>off, now can I? I've got a special mission!
<string>And that mission is to heal the hearts<lf>and souls of Elgado in my downtime!<lf>Get a glimpse of these soothing moves. ~♪
<string>Of COURSE I know about Malzeno!<lf>I'm more than just a pretty face, you<lf>know. ~♪
<string>That beastie is the Kingdom's Most<lf>Wanted! That's why we gotta smoke it out,<lf>corner it, and show it we mean business!
<string>Bad boys need to be punished, and my<lf>hunting horn's got a hankerin' for some<lf>spankerin'! Ooo, I can hardly WAIT! ~♪
<string>We've got a few guests from Kamura,<lf>do we? That's a long way they've<lf>come to meet us!
<string>Don't tell me they came all this way to<lf>see little ol’ me? Just imagine the<lf>pile of autographs they'd want!
<string>It isn't easy being this pretty! Still,<lf>gotta think of the fans, y'know? Guess<lf>I oughta stretch my signing hand. ~♪
<string>Good gravy, Galleus Poo must have<lf>been REEEEAL angry...
<string>I can't stand getting chewed out, and<lf>I hate, hate, haaate getting raked over<lf>the coals!
<string>And if it's my Galleus Poo taking me<lf>to task, how's a girl supposed to<lf>even get out of bed in the morning!?
<string>Still, if he ever ends up dressing you down,<lf>you come see me, OK? Your Paz'll always<lf>be here to cheer you back up. ~♪
<string>Heavens to Betsy! I hear our local<lf>beasties've been romping outside<lf>their Kingdom playpen.
<string>Bad monsters, no biscuit! Pazzy Poo's<lf>gonna have to tan some hides!
<string>First I'll give 'em a little bitta HNNGH!<lf>Followed by a taste of WAH-PAH! And<lf>finally a cha-KOW!! That'll learn 'em!
<string>Off to play with that Garangolm, I hear!<lf>You may be tough as nails, but Garangolm<lf>claws? That's a whole other story.
<string>That thing's no slouch! If you find yourself<lf>worn down by one of those Three Lordsies,<lf>just think of your dearest Paz, 'K? ~♪
<string>I'll fly to wherever you are and give you<lf>a second wind! ~♪ Well, not literally.<lf>Like, spiritually? You know what I mean!
<string>Um? Is it my imagination, or did everyone<lf>in Elgado get a bit more pep in their steps?
<string>Ohh, I get it! It's because Bahari's back!<lf>Big welcome back energy for the big guy. ~♪
<string>Everyone was all worried sick about him!<lf>I'll give him a slap on the wrist later.<lf>And don't worry...I'll be gentle. ~♪
<string>Ick, ptooey! Ick ick iiick, I can't even<lf>deal!
<string>Those Qurio gross me ooout! I can't take<lf>it! Ick, ick, I can't even THINK about 'em!<lf>Ewwwwww!
<string>Even a glimpse of those gross things are<lf>sure to give me nightmares! Uuugh, gag!
<string>I hear tell you found Malzeno! That deserves<lf>a clap on the back! Oh, unless that punk<lf>took a chunk out of it.
<string>Whaaat, Fiorayne's hurt!? Shut your<lf>face, is she OK!?
<string>What!? She got off with just a scratch!?<lf>Phew, THAT's a relief to hear... Don't<lf>go biting off more'n you can chew, OK?
<string><VO:SER>Fiorayne's unconscious!? That's awful!<lf>Aw jeez... Is she really OK...?
<string>—Yikesee-poo! Elgado's songstress can't<lf>go around looking down and out! Gotta<lf>put on a happy face for the people!
<string><VO:NOR>Times like these is when we need smiles<lf>the most. ~♪ Even the tiniest smile lets<lf>the sun shine in!
<string>I hear tell you hunted an Espinas.<lf>You're the gift that just keeps on giving,<lf>ain't ya!?
<string>Fiorayne's sure to get better now, too!
<string>Get over here, I've got some head pats<lf>with your name on them. Who's a good<lf>Hunter? WHOOO'S A GOOD HUNTER!?
<string>Fiiinally, it's time to lay the smackdown<lf>on that naughty ol' Malzeno!
<string>First he hurts poor Fiorayne, then he<lf>scares the crap out of the Kingdom! Bad<lf>boys like him deserve a real whipping!
<string>I'll leave the juicy bits to you, of<lf>course. ~♪ Give 'em the ol' Kamura<lf>clobber! And an Elgado one-two, to boot!
<string>You whooped that Malzeno good, so why's<lf>my Paz sense tingling? You feeling this too?
<string>Could it be...? No, it couldn't... Or<lf>COULD it? Nahhhhh. But then again...<lf>Ah, shucks. ~♪
<string>Forget it, just talking to myself! Good<lf>luck on your quests today, your Pazzy<lf>Poo is rooting for yooooooou! ~♪
<string>Oh snap, the air around here's practically<lf>buzzing! I knew it, the Paz sense is never<lf>wrong!
<string>Even the sun's taking a siesta today...<lf>I'd say we're getting to some sorta<lf>climax here.
<string>Whatever it is, I don't like it. Careful,<lf>Hunter! You and Paz're gonna get through<lf>this disaster together, you'll see! ~♪
<string>The Archdemon of the Abyss! I knew<lf>it'd turn out like this, I could feel it in<lf>my bones!
<string>Forgive me for keeping it close to the<lf>chest, yeah? Investigating that fairy<lf>tale is the job of us Chevaliers.
<string>If we're out in the open about it, just<lf>think of all those Elgado boots shaking<lf>in the streets! Can't have that, can we?
<string>But hey, we've got you on our side,<lf>Hunter! It'll all work out!
<string>I was shook at first, but no way was<lf>I scared—not with you around! I trust<lf>you through and through. ~♪ You got this!
<string>Now THIS is what I'm talking about!<lf>The weather's perfect, and the water's<lf>practically begging for a dip. ~♪
<string>Thanks to you, peeps on the streets are<lf>back to their old happy selves. ~♪
<string>Forcing a smile to weather the tough<lf>times doesn't do a thing for me!
<string>Seeing everyone happy from the bottoms <lf>of their hearts is the best! ~♪ Let's keep<lf>that ol' smile train runnin'! ~♪
<string>Hmm-hmm-hmmmm ~♪ Hnn-hnnn-hnn ~♪<lf>Hmmm-hnn-hmm-mmm-mmm ~♪
<string>Not a bad set a pipes, huh? I always<lf>appreciate an appreciative ear. ~♪
<string>Before I joined the Order, I made my<lf>living as a singer! That's why the music<lf>just bubbles up from time to time. ~♪
<string>The fine folks of Elgado must breathe easier<lf>with an earful of my calming chords, don't<lf>you think? Hmm-hmm-hmmmm ~♪
<string>I've taken a real shine to this place!<lf>The water's crystal clear, the sun shines<lf>bright. It's like one big stage!
<string>Paz's exclusive Elgado stage... I can't<lf>even! It's spectacular! Sensational! A<lf>gal might never leave...
<string>...Oops, on second thought, too much<lf>time in the sun's no good. Gotta take<lf>care of my skin, y'know. ~♪
<string>I've been getting a steady supply of<lf>sweet Bunny Dango. ~♪ I love every<lf>ambrosial mouthful, it's just...
<string>Truth is, it's the spicy ones—and I mean<lf>the REAL spicy ones—that get my heart<lf>SINGING! And burning, sure.
<string>It's like a fiery party in my mouth, and<lf>everyone's invited! And as the guest of<lf>honor, I just can't get enough. ~♪
<string>Everyone in Elgado's curious as a Felyne<lf>to figure out what we Chevaliers get up<lf>to around here!
<string>Most of the time we're just like other knight!<lf>Just with a little bit of a special twist.
<string>I do my share of questing—darn well, I<lf>might add! Anyone doubt my skills, I'll<lf>give 'em a taste—up-close n' personal. ~♪
<string>Say, um... something's been bothering<lf>me lately. Help a girl out, would you?
<string>Like, I'm cute, sing like a nightingale,<lf>got fans out the tuchus... So how come<lf>my love life's dead in the water?
<string>And don't get me started on my hunting<lf>prowess. There ain't another gal like<lf>your Pazzy Poo for nautical miles!
<string>...Oh. Ohhh, NOW I get it! I'm, like, way<lf>outta everyone's league, like, next level.<lf>Like, Super Ultra Master Rank!
<string>Right, got it, I tell ya, being this cute<lf>is a curse! ~♪
<string>I challenged Galleus Poo to a match<lf>back in the day, y'know! I'm talking<lf>way before I ended up in Elgado.
<string>I heard rumors of this super-duper tough<lf>guy, and I just had to see where he<lf>landed on the Paz toughness scale. ~♪
<string>I'm not talking about a slugfest, but<lf>a contest of speed! Seeing who could<lf>complete their quest faster.
<string>Wasn't even a contest. He blew me out<lf>of the water! Really put me in my place,<lf>and more than lived up to the hype.
<string>I was still a singer back then, but<lf>I admired the poo out of that strength—<lf>hence the sudden career change. ~♪
<string>The rest is history: Galleus Poo made me<lf>a Chevalier, and wham, bam, I'm second-<lf>in-command! Impressed yet? ~♪
<string>
<string>
<string>
<string>Your Pazzy Poo has a request for you! ~♪
<string>Oh, Hunter! Did you come over to help out<lf>your favorite Pazzy Poo? You did! ~♪ Aren't<lf>you sweet! So check this out...
<string>Like a dummy, I promised someone I'd go<lf>get them some elder dragon materials,<lf>but—OOPS!—totally double booked myself.
<string>If you can grab them for me, I'll teach<lf>ya how to upgrade a super-special,<lf>Pazzy Poo-approved weapon! ~♪
<string>OK, here's the list of everything I need!<lf>Thank you so much. You know you're<lf>the bestest ever-est, right? ~♪
<string>Thank yooooooooou! ~♪
<string>Oh, you've finished my request already!? ~♪<lf>Your reward is right here in my hand—<lf>a special pat on the head from me! ~♪
<string>Just kidding! It's over at the Smithy, silly! ~♪
<string>Thanks a whole bunch for helping me out! ~♪<lf>Now I can get back to CRUSHING MONSTERS!<lf>Oh, did I scare you! Sorry! Hehehe! ~♪
