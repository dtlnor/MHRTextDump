<string>OK, you're all set! Get going!
<string><NOFAC>...Alright, all packed up and ready<lf>to go see Ace in Elgado—
<string>...Huh? No way! I was JUST about to<lf>go see you, and now you're here!<lf>Gnarly instincts ya got there, Ace!
<string>And even gnarlier timing! I've got some<lf>new Switch Skills I wanna show you!
<string>Some of these babies are based on<lf>the Royal Order's skills! I'm sure as<lf>shurikens you're gonna love 'em!
<string>They'll definitely have you thrashin' like<lf>you've never thrashed before. Let's head<lf>to the Training—
<string>Oh, you have an urgent quest to take<lf>care of? Oh, my bad, Ace! Well, off<lf>you go then!
<string>Wait, wait. You know what? If you're<lf>heading out to the Jungle maybe we<lf>should register it as a quest.
<string>You'll get a reward if you take out<lf>any monsters that attack you.<lf>Well then, get going, Ace!
<string>We got trouble...
<string><NOFAC>Sup, Ace! Sounds like some gnarly<lf>business is goin' on. Did you talk<lf>to Rondine yet?
<string>She's looking for you <COLS RED>near the entrance<lf>to the village</COL>. Go put her mind at ease!
<string>I'm just gonna be gatherin' some more intel<lf>before I report to the Elder!
<string>Time to thrash!
<string><NOFAC>Yo, Ace! How 'bouts it, huh? You and<lf>me go out and thrash some monsters<lf>together?
<string>You know it's been kinda lame around<lf>here lately. And we've never, like,<lf>properly hunted together.
<string>I'm dying to get gnarly on a monster—<lf>*ahem* I mean, "As your master, I must<lf>constantly monitor your progress—"
<string>What? Am I *sure* that I want to go out<lf>hunting in my free time? WHAT!? Of<lf>course, I'm sure! As sure as shurikens!
<string>Anyway, the quest is already set up<lf>and ready to go, so when you're ready<lf>to thrash, let's THRASH!
<string>Way to thrash out there!
<string><NOFAC>Whoa! You really got gnarly out there, Ace!<lf>*sniff* M-Makes a master proud...<lf>*ahem*
<string>I hear you've been gettin' gnarly out in<lf>Elgado too!
<string>Looks like going abroad has really<lf>broadened your skills! That's my Ace,<lf>always learning! *sniff* I'm so proud—
<string>*ahem* I know it can be tough leaving Kamura,<lf>but even when you're out thrashin' far away,<lf>know that we're thinking about you. OK?
<string>Time to thrash!
<string><NOFAC>Yo, Ace! Great timing. Just got a report<lf>that a Lunagaron is acting gnarly out<lf>in the Shrine Ruins.
<string>I was gonna go thrash it solo, but since<lf>you're here, we can get gnarly on it<lf>together!
<string>And it's your lucky day too. Why? Today<lf>you get to witness what your master's<lf>REALLY made of!
<string>Anyway, the quest is already set up<lf>and ready to go, so when you're ready<lf>to thrash, let's THRASH!
<string>Way to thrash out there!
<string><NOFAC>Whoa! You really got gnarly out there<lf>on those Kingdom monsters, Ace!
<string>And your skills have improved so much. But<lf>no matter how much you improve, a hunter's<lf>training is never done. Don't forget that!
<string>And although it wasn't planned, Elder<lf>Fugen made the right move sending<lf>you off into action.
<string>The peeps you meet and the monsters you<lf>take on will all guide you to even greater<lf>heights. And... *sniff* I can't wait to see it!
<string>Time to thrash!
<string><NOFAC>Yo, Ace! How's my favorite pupil?
<string>Well, I hope you're doing well because<lf>it's that time again! What time is it?<lf>TIME TO THRASH!
<string>And if we thrash together, the quest'll<lf>be done in half the time— Wait, or will<lf>the monster be double thrashed? Uh...
<string>Either way, the quest is already set up<lf>and ready to go, so when you're ready<lf>to thrash, let's THRASH!
<string>Way to thrash out there!
<string><NOFAC>Whoa! You really got gnarly out there, Ace!<lf>You've come a long way, that's for sure!
<string>And great news, by the way. Since things<lf>continue to be boring around here, I've got<lf>more free time to go hunting with ya!
<string>I need to learn more about Kingdom<lf>monsters myself. And no one better<lf>to do it with than my favorite pupil!
<string>But, even if things are quiet right now,<lf>I have to ninja run straight back to Kamura,<lf>if Elder Fuges summons me.
<string>But I don't see that happenin' anytime soon...<lf>So, like, if you got any free time, let's go<lf>get gnarly on some mons sometime, OK!?
<string>Sup, Ace!<lf>So you're bailin on us, huh? Ha!<lf>Just kidding!
<string>Although it does make me kinda sad... *sniff*<lf>But, hey, this'll be a new beginning for you.<lf>The next chapter in the Book of Thrash!
<string>And since I taught you everything you know,<lf>I know you'll be thrashing up a storm no<lf>matter where you go!
<string>Now that we're collaborating with the<lf>Kingdom, I've been coordinating sweeps<lf>of the area with members of the Order.
<string>There's a lot of work to do and we're<lf>gonna be busy, but not as busy as<lf>you, though!
<string>In fact, this whole show basically comes<lf>down to you!
<string>It's a lot of responsibility, but don't sweat it,<lf>Ace! We'll back you up, and you've got<lf>some gnarly support in Elgado, too.
<string>There's nothing we can't do if we all<lf>thrash together! Let's do this, Ace!
<string>Hey, welcome home, Ace! You doing<lf>OK? Nothing much going on here.<lf>Same 'ol Kamura, ya know?
<string>But everyone's dying to hear about<lf>how things are going over in Elgado.
<string>I keep everyone updated the best I can.<lf>Never leaving out even a single detail,<lf>but...
<string>As much as everyone enjoys hearing stories<lf>about you, they just wanna see their Ace<lf>back in Kamura safe and sound!
<string>Dude, what is the deal with your Cohoot?<lf>As soon as those saucer eyes lock on me,<lf>it gets to swoopin'!
<string>It's gotta be because of that gnarly Zinogre<lf>impression I did that one time. Totally<lf>freaked your little feathered friend out!
<string>But I was thinking, though. Let's say it<lf>basically thinks I'm a Zinogre, right?
<string>That means if it saw a real Zinogre, it<lf>might go for it like it goes for me. And<lf>that would be really dangerous.
<string>So could you, like, maybe get it to stop?<lf>At least teach it that I'm a gnarly ninja<lf>and NOT a thunderpuppy?
<string>Every once in a blue moon, Elder Fuges<lf>sends me to the Kingdom's capital to<lf>deliver a message.
<string>If you thought there was a lot going on<lf>in Elgado, you should see the capital!<lf>Talk about sophisticated!
<string>Wish I could take my time and check out all<lf>the gnarly sights and stuff, but whenever<lf>I'm there, it's because of some emergency...
<string>I'd love to go with you sometime! Maybe<lf>after this is all over we can go together!
<string>As soon as everyone here heard things<lf>had settled down, they were all dying<lf>to know when you'd be coming back.
<string>I kept saying I thought you'd be<lf>back soon, but I was worried you might<lf>still be needed over there.
<string>So I'm glad you've come to show your<lf>face. It's put the village at ease.
<string>And me!<lf>It's great to have you back, Ace!
<string>Sup, Ace? Worried about thrashin' in<lf>unknown territory?
<string>Pfft. You'll be fine! You're the greatest<lf>pupil I've ever had!
<string>Your gnarliness is known by hunters<lf>far and wide! That's why the Kingdom's<lf>called on you now!
<string>But if you're ever feeling overwhelmed, just<lf>come back to me—er, us! *ahem* I've<lf>made sure Rondine's ship will be available.
<string>You've got nothing to fear, my friend!<lf>Go get 'em, Ace!
<string>I'm slowly starting Ayame back on her<lf>training. Obviously we're keeping a<lf>close eye on her injuries.
<string>Getting injured is no joke. Look after<lf>yourself out there.
<string>I know that's a tough request, especially<lf>with all the gnarly situations we put<lf>you in.
<string>But in the same way you feel like there<lf>are things you wanna protect, everyone<lf>here wants to protect you.
<string>If anything happened to you, it would<lf>hit us all hard. No one wants peace at<lf>the expense of your life.
<string>Everyone in Kamura's praying for your<lf>safety every day. Don't ever forget that,<lf>Ace!
<string>So check this out. The other day, Hinoa<lf>came up to me while I was working on<lf>my monster impressions.
<string>She was like, "Whoa, that's so gnarly!<lf>Can you teach me?" Not her words<lf>exactly, but you get the point.
<string>Either way, I showed her a few tricks,<lf>and, well...
<string>It's pre-tty crazy, Ace. In true Hinoa fashion<lf>she totally nailed it. I mean, NAILED IT,<lf>nailed it.
<string>It made me realize why Elder Fuges told<lf>me to be careful of my surroundings, you<lf>know, to keep from scaring people...
<string>Sup, Ace? Have you been taking care<lf>of yourself out in Elgado?
<string>Your physical health is your top priority<lf>as a hunter. Remember what I taught<lf>you! "Eat well and rest well!"
<string>Taishi's really taken it to heart. And<lf>he's getting stronger by the day.<lf>Reminds me of you, actually.
<string>He's got a long ways to go but he's<lf>gonna be another Ace, for sure!
<string>Hmmm... That sounds lame. Needs to<lf>be more epic— Oh! Sup, Ace!
<string>So I was tryin' to tell Master Hamon all about<lf>your gnarly adventures over in Elgado and<lf>he was like, "Just give me the highlights..."
<string>And I was like, "The highlights!?"<lf>I mean, I know the guy's really busy,<lf>but COME ON!
<string>How can I shuriken slash all of the details<lf>out of everything you do!? There's too much<lf>epicness to leave anything out. Right!?
<string>I mean check this list out! A Garangolm,<lf>a Lunagaron, an Espinas, Malzeno...<lf>COME ON! MALZENO! Too gnarly, yo...
<string>Surely that's way more interesting than<lf>polishing the same blade for a hundred hours...
<string>Sup, Ace! Welcome back!
<string>Always brings a smile to my face to see<lf>my favorite pupil back in Kamura!
<string>I mean, I know we hang out in Elgado<lf>sometimes, too, but there's nothing<lf>like being back in Kamura, am I right?
<string>And since you're here, you should relax<lf>a little. You know what they say:<lf>Work hard, rest hard!
<string>You ready to go thrash that Amatsu?
<string><VO:SER>And while I'm super pumped to go out on<lf>a quest with you, Ace, we gotta stay focused.<lf>We can't let Yomogi and Kagero down!
<string>We gotta take this thing down, not just<lf>for them, but for everyone who lost their<lf>lives...
<string>Yo, Ace! We did it! Our master and pupil<lf>combo is absolutely unstoppable! I still can't<lf>believe how gnarly you were out there!
<string>You were all over the place! That hoser<lf>didn't stand a chance! Haha! Just thinkin'<lf>about it fills me with pride! *sniff*
<string>*ahem* Anyway, I'm so proud of ya! We all<lf>are! I look forward to seein' all the gnarly<lf>things you do in the future! Keep it up, Ace!
<string>Jeez, ANOTHER gnarly life-and-death<lf>emergency in the Kingdom!?
<string>Well, I'm not too worried. I mean, you thrashed<lf>the livin' daylights out of Amatsu. I know you<lf>can handle things on your own, Ace!
<string>—Hm? We don't know anything about it?<lf>The only thing to know is that it's a monster<lf>and monsters get thrashed!
<string>Wait... What's that immensely powerful<lf>aura I feel...? Why, it's my favorite pupil!<lf>Back already, are ya?
<string>Just look at you being all majestic and<lf>awesome! It's enough to make your Master<lf>cry! *sniff* I'm so proud of you, Ace!
<string>*ahem* As long as you're doin' great,<lf>I'M doin' great! Just remember to eat<lf>plenty and rest plenty, OK!?
<string>The only bummer is that I go through<lf>whetstones like crazy...
