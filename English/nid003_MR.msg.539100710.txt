<string>Oh, my...
<string><NOFAC>Welcome home, <PL>.<lf>I trust your hunting life is prospering in Elgado.
<string>I heard that "Rondayne's" sister, "Fjordine,"<lf>was injured. Perhaps you have paid me a visit<lf>to ask me about a certain someone, yes?
<string><COLS RED>Doctor Tadori</COL> is a dear friend of mine.<lf>He is one of the few who survived<lf>the destruction of my homeland.
<string>Since then, we've only spoken through letter.<lf>He's never in one place for very long and<lf>is often out procuring herbs for medicine.
<string>He had mentioned in a recent letter that<lf>he was on his way to the Jungle. I think<lf>it's safe to assume he's still there.
<string>...Oh, and if you see Tadori, might I ask you<lf>to deliver a message for me?
<string>"Her highness is living a wonderful and fulfilling<lf>life in Kamura. Please visit sometime and try<lf>some of her delicious Bunny Dango."
<string>He'll know what this means. Forgive me,<lf>but I feel it would be better coming from<lf>you rather than a letter.
<string>Oh, and by the way... Master Utsushi was just<lf>about to depart for Elgado to see you.
<string>He had something he wanted to discuss<lf>with you. It might be a good idea to drop<lf>by and see what it is.
<string>Lady "Rondayne" was revealed to be a<lf>knight of the Kingdom, was she not? That<lf>certainly explains her faultless conduct.
<string>And yet, that suggests that she only<lf>learned of tradecraft just before gracing<lf>our fair village...
<string>The sheer level of profit she's fostered<lf>with just that seems nigh-impossible!<lf>Her knack for business is most uncommon.
<string>I feel compelled to suggest to her a change<lf>of occupation, but...what would become<lf>of my own? I shudder to think of it.
<string>Greetings, <PL>.<lf>Preparing for imminent departure, I see?
<string>Do not hesitate to call on me if I may<lf>be of assistance. I serve at your<lf>pleasure.
<string>That being said, I am confident that<lf>the Kingdom's outpost, too, would have<lf>all the commodities you require.
<string>I have peddled my wares there on<lf>multiple occasions. A robust and<lf>refreshing locale, to be sure.
<string>Stay safe out there. Remember to come<lf>back and visit us from time to time.
<string>Oh <PL>, you're back?<lf>Welcome home. How are things holding up<lf>out there?
<string>Everyone in the village is most excited<lf>to be working with Elgado to investigate<lf>these invading monsters from the Kingdom.
<string>If monsters from the Kingdom have truly<lf>appeared in Kamura, it could mean the<lf>end for our village.
<string>Perhaps it may lead to an event of the<lf>same scale as The Rampage. We'll do<lf>all we can to help with supplies.
<string>Master <PL>, have you tried<lf>the Bunny Dango in Elgado? What am<lf>I saying? Of course you have.
<string>I make sure to stop by and savor a few<lf>whenever I visit.
<string>The fact that they can be enjoyed even in<lf>Elgado is simply marvelous. Yomogi and<lf>the others have done such wonderful work.
<string>The only problem is that even a single bite<lf>fills my thoughts with scenes of Kamura.
<string>And once that happens I feel the sudden<lf>urge to make my way back here as soon<lf>as Wyverianly possible. Hehehe.
<string>Tadori mentioned in a letter the other day<lf>that he was on his way to the Jungle. I<lf>think it's safe to assume he's still there.
<string>I feel embarrassed to ask, but...would you<lf>mind passing on a message for me?
<string>It looks like you were able to meet Tadori.<lf>I'm glad I could be of some help to you,<lf>if only just a little.
<string>Tadori is skilled in the art of herbology.<lf>Some say he even quelled a terrible<lf>plague in the Kingdom many years ago.
<string>I'm sure Fjordine will recover in no time<lf>at all. Please, rest your mind at ease.
<string>Weren't Tadori's skills just wonderful?<lf>I'm glad to hear that Fjordine is feeling<lf>better, too.
<string>Back home, his herbal remedies and medicines<lf>helped a great number of our people. *sigh*<lf>Reminds me of the good old days...
<string>Komitsu was shopping here the other day.
<string>We spoke briefly, but she seemed<lf>distracted by Seihaku's recent strange<lf>behavior.
<string>If you ask me that's the same ol' Seihaku.<lf>But it did make me wonder if something<lf>might be up...
<string>Zenchi overheard our conversation and<lf>said that even he couldn't cure that<lf>kind of disease.
<string>Then finally it hit me. Not even Tadori<lf>could conjure up a potion potent enough<lf>to fix that poor child's condition. Hehehe.
<string>I heard Elgado's market offers a wide<lf>selection of goods? I suppose we have<lf>Oboro and Tadori to thank for that.
<string>I'm sure there's nothing here in the village<lf>that you can't find in the Elgado Market,<lf>but still...
<string>I'm just glad we were able to see each<lf>other again...<lf>......
<string>...Oh, come on!<lf>There must be SOMETHING I can interest<lf>you in?
<string>Many of my merchant friends do not<lf>stay rooted in one place for long.
<string>An associate of mine once told me that<lf>they were not interested in getting "too<lf>involved" with a particular place. 
<string>But after all that everyone has done for<lf>me in this wonderful village, I couldn't<lf>possibly imagine not coming home to it.
<string>Having lost my home, I suppose I'm a bit<lf>more particular about having a place to<lf>return to than others...
<string>If you can believe it, our dear Yomogi<lf>has become ever more enthusiastic<lf>about her craft, since your departure.
<string>Why, yesterday I heard her boasting<lf>of a new recipe she plans to make<lf>available in Elgado.
<string>Everyday, the Tea Shop—no, the entire<lf>village—is filled with her irresistible<lf>charm and energy.
<string>Witnessing her happiness warms my<lf>heart and puts a smile on my face.<lf>...Even if you cannot see it.
<string>After you left, I would often see Master<lf>Hojo pacing restlessly around the village.<lf>Oh, how he worried about you!
<string>But now that you've become accustomed<lf>to your new environment, he seems to<lf>have settled down a bit.
<string>While Master Hojo has come to terms with<lf>you "flying the nest," perhaps there is<lf>someone who has yet to let go? Hmmm?
<string>I rarely see Master Utsushi in the village<lf>as of late. Perhaps he's keeping an eye on<lf>a particular "fledgling" hunter? Hehehe.
<string>I tease. Forgive me. I'm positive that,<lf>like Master Hojo, he'll come around.
<string>I don't suppose you've run into Pasapato yet,<lf>have you?
<string>We had the chance to sit down and speak<lf>several times when I visited Elgado to sell<lf>my wares.
<string>There seems to be no limit to the amount<lf>of knowledge he possesses. He told many<lf>a fascinating tale!
<string>I've also heard that Master Utsushi has been<lf>spending a lot of time with him as well.<lf>I must say that I'm quite envious.
<string>Perhaps I shall pay him a visit in Elgado<lf>once things have calmed down. It has been<lf>such a long time since we've spoken...
<string>Terrifying monsters aren't just found<lf>around the village, the Kingdom has<lf>their fair share of them as well.
<string>I must admit, I am truly in awe of your<lf>ability to hunt such beasts.
<string>It's thanks to you and your deeds that<lf>the people of these lands can live in<lf>peace. You have my thanks.
<string>I do hope that Tadori will come and visit<lf>once his work in Elgado has settled down.
<string>The only contact I've had with him since<lf>leaving my home is by correspondence...
<string>Above all, I would love for him to see how<lf>much her highness has grown...
<string>However, I'm afraid that not talking to him<lf>cloth-to-face for so long would make for<lf>an awkward situation.
<string>You...perhaps...wouldn't mind joining us,<lf>would you?
<string><VO:SER>I have fulfilled my queen's last wish<lf>to keep Lady Yomogi safe.
<string>Now I must avenge my home and destroy<lf>that creature for robbing me of my queen<lf>and everyone so very dear to me...
<string>However, Elder Fugen is correct when he<lf>says that I am too consumed by anger to<lf>ever stand a chance against that beast.
<string>And yet... I...
<string>If Lady Yomogi hadn't shown up just in<lf>time to stop me, surely I too would have<lf>perished in that foul beast's winds...
<string>I was blinded by my own rage, but the<lf>princess saved me from my demise.
<string>And then you and Master Utsushi defeated<lf>Amatsu for me... <PL>, I cannot<lf>thank you enough.
<string>You have released me from my torment...<lf>It's as if the clouds have dispersed and<lf>the sky can be blue again.
<string>Another type of Malzeno... Oh, dear...<lf>Just when we thought the Kingdom's<lf>troubles were behind them.
<string>Though things might seem bleak, I'm certain<lf>your flame will guide the Kingdom through<lf>this! I'm sure Tadori and Oboro would agree!
<string>You saved Kamura and the Kingdom,<lf>and you even avenged my home...<lf>You are the greatest hero of them all!
<string>To think that such a champion started<lf>out by shopping at my humble market...<lf>It is an honor that knows no bounds!
<string>I shall continue to aid you in your endeavors.<lf>If you ever have need of anything, do not<lf>hesitate to call upon me!
<string>Oh my, it's—!
<string><NOFAC><PL>, what might you<lf>have there!?
<string>As I recall, Oboro was searching for something<lf>of the sort. Why not pay him a visit?
